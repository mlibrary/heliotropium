The line between poetry (the delicate, surprising not-quite) and the essay (the emphatic so-there!) is thin, easily crossed. Both welcome a deep mulling-over, endlessly mixing image and idea and running with scissors; certainly each distrusts the notion of premise or formulaic progression. Marianne Boruch's essays in The Little Death of Self emerged by way of odd details or bothersome questions that would not quit--Why does the self grow smaller as the poem grows enormous? Why does closure in a poem so often mean keep going? Must we stalk the poem or does the poem stalk us until the world clicks open? Boruch's intrepid curiosity led her to explore fields of expertise about which she knew little: aviation, music, anatomy, history, medicine, photography, fiction, neuroscience, physics, anthropology, painting, and drawing. There's an addiction to metaphor here, an affection for image, sudden turns of thinking, and the great subjects of poetry: love, death, time, knowledge. There's amazement at the dumb luck of staying long enough in an inkling to make it a poem at all. Poets such as Keats, Stevens, Frost, Plath, Auden, and Bishop, along with painters, inventors, doctors, scientists, composers, musicians, neighbors, friends, and family--all traffic blatantly or under the surface--and one gets a glimpse of such fellow travelers now and then.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPoetryxHistory and criticism. 0aAmerican essaysy21st century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aPoets on poetry40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9478071

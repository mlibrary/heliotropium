Although Nabokov experts have long noted the importance of this relationship, this is the very first book-length study on this crucial subject. In this book, Shapiro explores the unique nature of their bond, which Nabokov characterized as that of the "tender friendship" marked by the "charm of our perfect accord," particularly exceptional when compared to numerous father-and-son relationships in Russian and Western European literature of the 19th and 20th centuries"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aNabokov, Vladimir,d1869-1922xFamily.10aNabokov, Vladimir Vladimirovich,d1899-1977xFamily. 0aFathers and sonszRussiavBiography. 0aAuthors, Russiany20th centuryvBiography. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.6025889

American poet's theater proliferated in the postwar period, when rich, performance-oriented poetry and theater scenes came together on the makeshift stages of urban coffee houses, shared apartments, and underground theaters. And yet its importance and history have been almost entirely ignored by critics. Acts of Poetry shines a spotlight on the practice of poet's theater by examining key groups and practitioners. Bringing together cultural history and criticism, it maps poet's theater in relation to performance practices such as poetry readings, avant-garde theater, and conceptual art and demonstrates not only the emergence of poet's theater in the postwar period but its continuation and legacy today.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPerformance poetry. 0aTheaterzUnited Statesy20th centuryxHistory. 0aAmerican dramay20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9373485

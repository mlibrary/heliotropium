In vivid prose that brings the music alive for both aficionados and newcomers, Mark Stryker details the lives and impact of more than two dozen key musicians, while also connecting the dots between players, eras, styles and the turbulent history of Detroit. The book explores how Detroit became a center for modern jazz and sustained its influence over decades -- graduating scores of musicians to the national scene and a striking number of innovators into the pantheon. A unique confluence of economic, cultural, educational and artistic factors transformed the Detroit into a bebop factory in the 1940s and '50s. The auto industry created a thriving black working and middle class in Detroit that supported a vibrant nightlife. Meanwhile, the marriage of superb formal instruction in public schools with the informal academy that legendary pianist and guru Barry Harris ran in his home had a catalytic impact on jazz in Detroit. Musicians rolled off an assembly line, all part of a unified fleet yet each a one-of-a-kind model with its own distinctive identity --  Hank, Thad and Elvin Jones, Milt Jackson, Yusef Lateef, Donald Byrd, Curtis Fuller, Kenny Burrell, Tommy Flanagan, Ron Carter and Joe Henderson coming to prominence. Musician-led cooperatives and self-determination efforts helped keep jazz flourishing in Detroit during the 1960s and '70s. In recent decades, even as the city's population fell sharply and economic might waned, Detroit continued to export significant talent to the major leagues. Detroit's culture of mentorship, embodied by trumpeter and teacher Marcus Belgrave, ensured that the city remained a national power as protâegâes like Geri Allen, Kenny Garrett, Robert Hurst, Regina Carter, Gerald Cleaver helped defined jazz in the late 20th and early 21st Centuries.  aCommon lineage and shared musical values link Detroit jazz musicians into an extended family defined by an allegiance to blues and swing, versatility, polished technique, musical intelligence and soulful expression. The ongoing resilience of Detroit's jazz tradition provides a powerful symbol of the city's lasting cultural influence and a metaphor for its nascent renaissance.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aJazzzMichiganzDetroitxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.4454129

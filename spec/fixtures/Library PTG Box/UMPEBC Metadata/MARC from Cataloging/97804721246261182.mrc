It advances a new theoretical approach to assessing the quality of democracy in divided societies, and puts it into practice with the focused comparison of two divided democracies-Estonia and Latvia. The book uses rich comparative data to tackle the vital questions of what determines a democracy's level of inclusiveness and the ways in which minorities can gain access to the policy-making process. It uncovers a "voice-polarization dilemma" for minorities' inclusion in the democratic process, which has implications for academic debates on minority representation and ethnic politics, as well as practical implications for international and national institutions' promotion of minority rights.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aSocial integrationzEurope. 0aDemocracyzEurope. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9992703

In this volume, European and US experts examine a range of perennial issues facing the Alliance, including relations with Russia, NATO's institutional organization and command structure, and the role of the United States in the Alliance, in order to show how these issues shape today's most pressing debate-the debate over the balance between NATO's engagement in security operations globally and traditional defense within the North-Atlantic region. The volume's contributors propose that NATO can indeed find a viable balance between competing, but not inherently incompatible, strategic visions. A theoretically informed, empirical account and analysis of NATO's recent evolution, this volume will appeal to both security scholars and practitioners from the policy community. -- Provided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aArms control. 0aNational securityzEurope. 0aEuropexDefenses. 4aElectronic books.1 aHilde, Paal Sigurd,d1970-1 aMichta, Andrew A.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.6980805

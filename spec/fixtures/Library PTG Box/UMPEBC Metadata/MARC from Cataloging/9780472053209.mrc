Christopher Coady explores the work ofone of the form's most vital practitioners, following Lewis from his role as an arranger for Miles Davis's Birth of the Cool sessions to his leadershipof the Modern Jazz Quartet, his tours of Europe, and his stewardship of the Lenox School of Jazz. Along the way Coady shows how Lewis's fusion works helped shore up a failing jazz industry in the wake of the 1940s big band decline, forging a new sound grounded in middle-class African American musical traditions. By taking into account the sociocultural milieu of the 1950s, Coady provides a wider context for understanding the music Lewis wrote for the Modern Jazz Quartet and sets up new ways of thinking about Cool Jazzand Third Stream music more broadly.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aLewis, John,d1920-2001xCriticism and interpretation. 0aAfrican American jazz musiciansxHistory and criticism. 0aThird stream (Music)xHistory and criticism. 0aJazzy1941-1950xHistory and criticism. 0aJazzy1951-1960xHistory and criticism. 0aMusic and racezUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aJazz perspectives (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.8890284

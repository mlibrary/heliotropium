Always haunted by the commodification of blackness, African American literary production interfaces with the processes of publication and distribution in particularly charged ways. An energetic exploration of the struggles and complexities of African American print culture, this collection ranges across the history of African American literature, and the authors have much to contribute on such issues as editorial and archival preservation, canonization, and the "packaging" and repackaging of black-authored texts. Publishing Blackness aims to project African Americanist scholarship into the discourse of textual scholarship, provoking further work in a vital area of literary study"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAmerican literaturexAfrican American authorsxHistory and criticismxTheory, etc. 0aCriticism, Textual. 0aAmerican literaturexAfrican American authorsxPublishingxHistory. 0aLiterature publishingxPolitical aspectszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aAfrican AmericansxIntellectual life. 0aAfrican Americans in literature. 4aElectronic books.1 aHutchinson, George,d1953-1 aYoung, John K.q(John Kevin),d1968-2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aEditorial theory and literary criticism.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.2580732

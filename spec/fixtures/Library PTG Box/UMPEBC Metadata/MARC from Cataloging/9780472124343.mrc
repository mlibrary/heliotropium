Sites of Translation illustrates the intricate rhetorical work that multilingual communicators engage in as they translate information for their communities. Blending ethnographic and empirical methods from multiple disciplines, Laura Gonzales provides methodological examples of how linguistic diversity can be studied in practice, both in and outside the classroom, and provides insights into the rhetorical labor that is often unacknowledged and made invisible in multilingual communication. Sites of Translation is relevant to researchers and teachers of writing as well as technology designers interested in creating systems, pedagogies, and platforms that will be more accessible and useful to multilingual audiences. Gonzales presents multilingual communication as intellectual labor that should be further valued in both academic and professional spaces, and supported by multilingual technologies and pedagogies that center the expertise of linguistically diverse communicators.  aSponsored by the Sweetland Digital Rhetoric Collaborative.1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivativesuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aTranslating and interpreting. 0aTranslanguaging (Linguistics) 0aMultilingual communication. 0aLanguage and culture. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.1 iSupplement:aBloom, Gina,tSites of translationh2 bilingual videos40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9952377

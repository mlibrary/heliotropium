During this period, the American national territory expanded beyond its continental borders to islands in the Pacific and the Caribbean. Simultaneously, new technologies of vision emerged for imagining the human body, including the moving camera, stereoscopes, and more efficient print technologies for mass media. Rather than focusing on canonical American authors who wrote at the time of U.S. imperialism, this book examines abject texts--images of naked savages, corpses, clothed native elites, and uniformed American soldiers--as well as bodies of writing that document the good will and violence of American expansion in the Philippine colony. Contributing to the fields of American studies, Asian American studies, and gender studies, the book analyzes the actual archive of the Philippine-American War and how the racialization and sexualization of the Filipino colonial native have always been part of the cultures of America and U.S. imperialism. By focusing on the Filipino native as an abject body of the American imperial imaginary, this study offers a historical materialist optic for reading the cultures of Filipino America"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aImperialismxSocial aspectszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aVisual communicationxPolitical aspectszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aHuman bodyxPolitical aspectszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aRacismxPolitical aspectszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aSexxPolitical aspectszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aPhilippinesxHistoryyPhilippine American War, 1899-1902xSocial aspects. 0aPhilippinesxHistoryyPhilippine American War, 1899-1902vSources. 0aPhilippinesxColonizationxSocial aspectsxHistory. 0aPhilippinesxRelationszUnited States. 0aUnited StatesxRelationszPhilippines. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.8841993

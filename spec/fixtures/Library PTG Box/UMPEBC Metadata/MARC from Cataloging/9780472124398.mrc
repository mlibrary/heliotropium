Ruins: Classical Theater and Broken Memory traces the remains, the remembering, and the forgetting of performance traditions of classical theater. The book argues that it is only when we look back over the accumulation of small evidence over a thousand-year sweep of classical theater that the remarkable and unequaled endurance of the tradition emerges. In the absence of more evidence, Odai Johnson turns instead to the absence itself, pressing its most legible gaps into a narrative about scars, vanishings, erasures, and silence: all the breakages that constitute the ruins of antiquity. In ten wide-ranging case studies, theater history and performance theory are brought together to examine the texts, artifacts, and icons left behind, reading them in fresh ways to offer an elegantly written, extended meditation on "how the aesthetic of ruins offered a model for an ideal that dislodged and ultimately stood in for the historic.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aTheaterzGreecexHistoryyTo 500. 0aTheaterzRomexHistoryyTo 500. 0aGreek dramaxHistory and criticism. 0aGreek literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aClassical dramaxHistory and criticism. 0aClassical literaturexHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aTheater--theory/text/performance.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9751073

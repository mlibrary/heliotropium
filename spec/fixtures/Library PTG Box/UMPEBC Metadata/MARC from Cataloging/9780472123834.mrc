Priscilla Layne offers a critique of how blackness came to symbolize a positive escape from the hegemonic masculinity of postwar Germany, and how black identities have been represented as separate from, and in opposition to, German identity, foreclosing the possibility of being both black and German. Citing four autobiographies published by black German authors Hans JuÌˆrgen Massaquo, Theodor Michael, GuÌˆnter Kaufmann, and Charly Graf, Layne considers how black German men have related to hegemonic masculinity since Nazi Germany, and concludes with a discussion on the work of black German poet, Philipp Khabo KoÌˆpsell."--Provided by publisher.  aIncludes filmography.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aWho's afraid of the black cook? -- Waiting for my band -- The blues and blue jeans : American dreams in the East -- Two black boys look at the white boy -- The future is unwritten.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aGerman literaturey20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aGerman literaturexBlack authorsxHistory and criticism. 0aBlacks in literature. 0aMasculinity in literature. 0aBlacks in popular culturezGermanyxHistoryy20th century. 0aMotion pictureszGermanyxHistoryy20th century. 0aBlacks in motion pictures. 0aMasculinity in motion pictures. 0aBlackszRace identityzGermany. 0aWhiteszRace identityzGermany. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9486889

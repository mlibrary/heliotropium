"Vitality" was a value for the American populace that was promulgated in the Progressive Era, following the model of the robustly healthy Theodore Roosevelt. Knadler explores how the goal of racial uplift in the period became associated with notions of African American vitality and debility, and traces these notions through a range of African American cultural production, particularly literature. The manuscript theorizes how these works "troubled and also redeployed a biopolitical management around slow violence, health, and disability central to the emergence of modern racial capitalism and liberal citizenship."Although the study focuses on the early twentieth century and writers of that era (e.g., Charles Chesnutt, W.E.B. Du Bois, Marita Bonner, Ann Petry, Angelina Grimke, Nella Larsen, Alain Locke, Jessie Fauset, Dorothy West), its conclusions are acutely relevant to today‚p0b9ss headlines, including the Black Lives Matter movement.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAfrican AmericansxCivil rightsxHealth aspects. 0aAmerican literaturexAfrican American authorsxHealth aspects. 0aBiopoliticszUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10043782

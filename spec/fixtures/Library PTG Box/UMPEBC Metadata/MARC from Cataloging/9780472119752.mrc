Until now there has been little scholarly discussion of underground music and its cultural, political, and aesthetic importance. In addition to providing a much-needed historical outline of this diverse scene, Stephen Graham focuses on the digital age, showing the underground and its fringes as based largely in radical anti-capitalist politics and aesthetics, tied to the political contexts and structures of late-capitalism. Sounds of the Underground explores these various ideas of separation and capture through interviews and analysis, developing a critical account of both the music and its political and cultural economy.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aUnderground musicxSocial aspects. 0aUnderground musicxPolitical aspects. 0aUnderground musicxHistory and criticism. 0aSubculture. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aTracking pop40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.8295270

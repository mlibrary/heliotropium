Beginning with a literary inquiry into the history of Japanese Americans in Hawaii and California, Garrett Hongo draws on his own history to consider the mosaic of American identities--personal, cultural, and poetic--in the context of a postmodern diaspora. Hongo's essays attest to the breadth of what he considers his cultural inheritance and literary antecedents, ranging from the poets of China's T'ang Dynasty to American poets such as Walt Whitman and Charles Olson. He explains free-verse prosody by way of John Coltrane's jazz; praises his contemporaries, poets David Mura, Edward Hirsch, and Mark Jarman; and acknowledges his mentors, Bert Meyers and Charles Wright. In other pieces he engages with controversies and contestations in contemporary Asian American literature, confronts the politics of race and the legacy of Japanese American internment during World War II, offers paeans to the Hawaiian landscape, and addresses immigrants newly arrived in America with a warm welcome. The Mirror Diary is the work of a poet fully engaged with contemporary politics and poetics and committed to the study and celebration of diverse traditions.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aJapanese AmericanszHawaiixHistory. 0aPoets, AmericanzHawaiiy20th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aPoets on poetry40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9408317

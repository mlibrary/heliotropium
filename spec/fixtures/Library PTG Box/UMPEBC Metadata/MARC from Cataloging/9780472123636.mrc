This exploration draws upon a rich array of examples from theatre, performance, and the arts, all of which provide vivid illustration of the book's central argument: that the rise of the surveillance society coincides with a profound collapse of democratic oversight and transparency--a collapse that, in turn, demands a radical rethinking of how performance practitioners conceptualize art and its political efficacy. The book thus makes the case that artists and critics must reexamine--indeed, must radically redefine--their notions of performance if they are to mount any meaningful counter to the increasingly invasive surveillance society.0 aIntro -- Contents -- Introduction.

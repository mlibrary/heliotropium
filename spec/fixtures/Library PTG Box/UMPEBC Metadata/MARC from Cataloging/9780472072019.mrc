We know all about Motown, the MC5, and Iggy and the Stooges. We also know about the important part the Motor City has played in the history of jazz. But there are stories about the music of Detroit that remain untold. One of the lesser known but nonetheless fascinating histories is contained within Detroit's country music roots. At last, Craig Maki and Keith Cady bring to light Detroit's most important country and western and bluegrass stars, such as Chief Redbird, the York Brothers, and Roy Hall. Beyond the individuals, Maki and Cady also map out the labels, radio programs, and performance venues that sustained Detroit's vibrant country and bluegrass music scene. In the process, Detroit Country Music examines how and why the city's growth in the early 20th century, particularly the southern migration tied to the auto industry, led to this vibrant roots music scene. The first book--the first resource of any kind--to tell the story of Detroit's contributions to country music, Detroit Country Music will be essential reading for music historians, record collectors, roots music fans, and Detroit music aficionados"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aCountry musiczMichiganzDetroitxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.1 aCady, Keith.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.5592531

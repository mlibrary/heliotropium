Throughout the book, Flory focuses on the central importance of "crossover" to the Motown story; first as a key concept in the company's efforts to reach across American commercial markets, then as a means to extend influence internationally, and finally as a way to expand the brand beyond strictly musical products. Flory's work reveals the richness of the Motown sound, and equally rich and complex cultural influence Motown still exerts.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aRhythm and blues musicxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aTracking pop40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.322080

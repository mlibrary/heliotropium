Nearly 100 years after its first formal introduction to the country, the novel continues to engage the imaginations of Japanese novelists, filmmakers, manga artists and others, resulting in numerous translations, adaptations, and dramatizations. On the Bullet Train with Emily Bronté is Pascoe's lively account of her quest to discover the reasons for the continuous Japanese embrace of Wuthering Heights, including quite varied and surprising adaptations of the novel. At the same time, the book chronicles Pascoe's experience as an adult student of Japanese. She contemplates the multiple Japanese translations of Bronté, as contrasted to the single (or non-existent) English translations of major Japanese writers. Carrying out a close reading of a distant country's Wuthering Heights, Pascoe begins to see American literary culture as a small island on which readers are isolated from foreign literature. In this and in her previous book, The Sarah Siddons Audio Files, Pascoe's engaging narrative innovates a new scholarly form involving immersive research practice to attempt a cross-cultural version of reader-response criticism. On the Bullet Train with Emily Bronté will appeal to scholars in the fields of 19th-century British literature, adaptation studies, and Japanese literary history"--cProvided by publisher.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aBrontë, Emily,d1818-1848.tWuthering Heights.10aBrontë, Emily,d1818-1848xAppreciationzJapan.10aBrontë, Emily,d1818-1848xInfluence.10aBrontë, Emily,d1818-1848xAdapatations. 0aReader-response criticismzJapan. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9373334

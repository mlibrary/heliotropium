Although aimed in large part at a scholarly audience, China and the West should appeal to general readers of many kinds: those interested in politics, cultural history and theory, gender studies, sociology, theater, and media studies as well as musical composition and performance of 'classical' as well as traditional and popular kinds.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aMusicxChinese influences. 0aMusiczChinaxWestern influences. 4aElectronic books.1 aSaffle, Michael,eauthor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.5555199

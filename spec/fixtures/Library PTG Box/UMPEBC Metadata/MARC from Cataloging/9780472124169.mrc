By focusing on the role Chinese classics (kanbun) played in the language employed by elite women, the chapters focus on how Empress Haruko, Shoen, and Shimoda Utako contributed new expectations for how women should participate in a modernizing Japan. By being in the public eye, all three women countered criticism of and commentary on their writings and activities, which they parried by navigating gender constraints. The success or failure as women ascribed to these three figures sheds light on the contradictions inhabited by them during a transformative period for Japanese women. By proposing and interrogating the possibility of Meiji women's power, the book examines contradictions that were symptomatic of their struggles within the vast social, cultural, and political transformations that took place during the period. The book demonstrates that an examination of that conflict within feminist history is crucial in order to understand what radical resistance meant in the face of women-centered authority.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aJapanxHistoryyMeiji period, 1868-1912. 0aWomenxEducationzJapanxHistory.00aShoÌ„ken,cEmpress, consort of Meiji, Emperor of Japan,d1850-1914.10aNakajima, ShoÌ„en,d1863-1901.10aShimoda, Utako,d1854-1936. 0aJapanxSocial life and customsy1868-1912. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aMichigan monograph series in Japanese studies ;v[86].40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9856453

D. Howells, Charles Chesnutt, and others, Emotional Reinventions: Realist-Era Representations Beyond Sympathy contends that emotional representations were central to the self-conscious construction of high realism (in the mid-1880s) and to the interrogation of its boundaries. Based on realist-era authors' rejection of "sentimentalism" and its reduction of emotional diversity (a tendency to stress what Karen Sanchez-Eppler has described as sentimental fiction's investment in "overcoming difference"), Melanie Dawson argues that realist-era investments in emotional detail were designed to confront differences of class, gender, race, and circumstance directly. She explores the ways in which representational practices that approximate scientific methods often led away from scientific theories and rejected rigid attempts at creating emotional taxonomies. She argues that ultimately realist-era authors demonstrated a new investment in individuated emotional histories and experiences that sought to honor all affective experiences on their own terms"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAmerican fictiony19th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aRealism in literature. 0aEmotions in literature. 0aIndividuality in literature. 0aDifference (Psychology) in literature. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.7807503

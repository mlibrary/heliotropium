Reagan symbolized a 1950s and 1960s America, largely white and suburban, with married couples and kids at home, who attended church more often than not. Obama's election marks a new era, the author writes. Whites will be a minority by 2042. Marriage is at an all-time low. Cohabitation has increased from a half-million couples in 1960 to more than 5 million in 2000 to even more this year. Gay marriages and civil unions are redefining what it means to be a family. And organized religions are suffering, even as Americans continue to think of themselves as a religious people. Obama's inauguration was a defining moment in the political destiny of this country, based largely on demographic shifts, as described in Barack Obama's America." -- Publisher's description.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aObama, Barack.10aReagan, Ronald. 0aFamilieszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aCoalitionszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aUnited StatesxSocial conditionsy1980- 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aContemporary political and social issues40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.17422

Disability as multitude : reworking nonproductive labor power.  aIn the neoliberal era, when human worth is measured by its relative utility within global consumer culture, selected disabled people have been able to gain entrance into late capitalist culture. The Biopolitics of Disability terms this phenomenon "ablenationalism" and asserts that "inclusion" becomes meaningful only if disability is recognized as providing modes of living that are alternatives to governing norms of productivity and independence. Thus, the book pushes beyond questions of impairment to explore how disability subjectivities create new forms of embodied knowledge and collective consciousness. The focus is on the emergence of new crip/queer subjectivities at work in disability arts, disability studies pedagogy, independent and mainstream disability cinema (e.g., Midnight Cowboy), internet-based medical user groups, anti-normative novels of embodiment (e.g., Richard Powers's The Echo-Maker) and, finally, the labor of living in "non-productive" bodies within late capitalism.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aDisability studies. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxCivil rights. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxSocial conditions. 0aDisabilitiesxGovernment policy. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxGovernment policy. 4aElectronic books.1 aSnyder, Sharon L.,d1963-2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aCorporealities.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.7331366

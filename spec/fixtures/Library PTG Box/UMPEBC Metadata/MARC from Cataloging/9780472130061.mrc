By emphasizing local agency and regional interdependencies, this metaphor reconfigures current narratives about the China India border and opens a new perspective on the long history of the Silk Roads, the modern BCIM Initiative, and dam construction along the Nu River in China and the Teesta River in India. Together, the authors show that positive interaction among people on both sides of a border generates larger, cross-border communities, which can pressure for cooperation and development. India China offers the hope that people divided by arbitrary geo-political boundaries can circumvent race, gender, class, religion, and other social barriers, to form more inclusive institutions and forms of governance"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aIndiaxForeign relationszChina. 0aChinaxForeign relationszIndia. 0aIndiazBoundarieszChina. 0aChinazBoundarieszIndia. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aConfigurations (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.6577564

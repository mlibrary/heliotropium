Like many others, I first saw Artaud through the filters of American experimental theater and post-structuralism. My earliest work on Artaud began from accepted familiar premises, largely established in the 1960s: Artaud as prophet, madman, genius, was the thing to study; his significance lay in his status as an inspirational figure manifesting a largely ahistorical impulse; his denunciation of civilization's discontents implied a progressive critique. My research led me in different directions, however. Fueled by a desire to really read Artaud's works closely especially his early writing and his productions--I dug into the archives to research Artaud's theatrical practice.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aArtaud, Antonin,d1896-1948xKnowledgexPerforming arts.10aArtaud, Antonin,d1896-1948xCriticism and interpretation. 0aCruelty in literature. 0aDramaxHistory and criticismxTheory, etc. 0aExperimental theaterzFrancexHistoryy20th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aTheater--text/theory/performance.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.345778

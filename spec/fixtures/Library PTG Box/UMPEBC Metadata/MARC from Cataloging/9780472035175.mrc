Choose from lighthouses anchored to the rugged shores of Lake Superior, Victorian mansions built by lumber and mining barons, rustic log lodges, and romantic small town hideaways. Meet the innkeepers themselves, who range from retired military officers and corporate heads to artists and poets. You'll find detailed descriptions of the accommodations along with information about rates, suitability for children, and policies on smoking and pets. Get a sense of the flavor and mood of each and learn about fun things to do in the surrounding areas. Numerous photos enhance the descriptions and provide a visitor's-eye view of some of the most unusual and delightful places to stay in Michigan"--cProvided by publisher.  aIncludes index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aHotelszMichiganvGuidebooks. 0aBed and breakfast accommodationszMichiganvGuidebooks. 0aRestaurantszMichiganvGuidebooks. 0aMichiganvGuidebooks. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.342912

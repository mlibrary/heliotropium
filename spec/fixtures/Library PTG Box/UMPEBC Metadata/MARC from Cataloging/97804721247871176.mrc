In this extensively revised and updated edition, Derek Beach and Rasmus Brun Pedersen introduce a refined definition of process-tracing, differentiating it into three distinct variants and explaining the applications and limitations of each. The authors develop the underlying logic of process-tracing, including how one should understand causal mechanisms and how Bayesian logic enables strong within-case inferences. They provide instructions for identifying the variant of process-tracing most appropriate for the research question at hand, and a set of guidelines for each stage of the research process.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aSocial sciencesxMethodology. 0aSocial sciencesxResearchxMethodology. 0aSocial sciencesvCase studies. 4aElectronic books.1 aPedersen, Rasmus Brun,d1978-eauthor.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10072208

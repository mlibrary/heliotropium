Constructivism Reconsidered synthesizes the nature of and debates on Constructivism in international relations, providing a systematic assessment of the Constructivist research program in IR to answer specific questions: What extent of (dis)agreement exists with regard to the meaning of Constructivism? To what extent is Constructivism successful as an alternative approach to rationalism in explaining and understanding international affairs? Constructivism Reconsidered explores Constructivism's theoretical, empirical, and methodological strengths and weaknesses, and debates what these say about its past, present, and future to reach a better understanding of IR in general and how Constructivism informs IR in particular.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aInternational relationsxPhilosophy. 0aConstructivism (Philosophy) 0aConstructivism. 4aElectronic books.1 aBertucci, Mariano E.,d1975-eeditor.1 aHayes, Jarrod,d1978-eeditor.1 aJames, Patrick,d1957-eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10017200

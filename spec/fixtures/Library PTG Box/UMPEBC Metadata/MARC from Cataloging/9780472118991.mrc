Casting the origins of Nazism in a new light, David Imhoof charts the process by which Weimar and Nazi culture flowed into each other. He analyzes this dramatic transition by looking closely at three examples of everyday cultural life in the mid-sized German city of Göttingen: sharpshooting, an opera festival, and cinema. Imhoof draws on individual and community experiences over a series of interwar periods to highlight and connect shifts in culture, politics, and everyday life. He demonstrates how Nazi leaders crafted cultural policies based in part on homegrown cultural practices of the 1920s and argues that overdrawn distinctions between "Weimar" and "Nazi" culture did not always conform to most Germans' daily lives. Further, Imhoof presents experiences in Göttingen as a reflection of the common reality of many German towns beyond the capital city of Berlin"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPolitics and culturezGermanyzGöttingenxHistoryy20th century. 0aGöttingen (Germany)xPolitics and governmenty20th century. 0aGöttingen (Germany)xSocial conditionsy20th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.5679888

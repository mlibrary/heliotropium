From the history textbook debates, to the Occupation-period exploitation of "comfort women," to the Dokdo/Takeshima territory dispute and Yasukuni Shrine visits, Professor Kimura traces the rise and fall of popular, political, and international concerns underlying these complex and highly-fraught issues. Utilizing Japanese and South Korean newspaper databases to review discussion of the two countries' disputed historical perceptions from the end of World War II to the present, The Burden of the Past provides readers with the historical framework and the major players involved, offering much-needed clarity on such polarizing issues. By seeing behind the public discourse and political rhetoric, this book offers a firmer footing for a discussion and the steps toward resolution.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aJapanxRelationszKorea (South) 0aKorea (South)xRelationszJapan. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10006543

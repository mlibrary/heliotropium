Unlike editions of an author's "selected works" or thematic anthologies, which clearly indicate the presence of non-authorial editorial intervention, collected editions have typically been arranged to imply an unmediated documentary completeness. By design, the collected edition obscures its own role in shaping the cultural reception of the author. In Proofs of Genius, Amanda Gailey argues that decisions to re-edit major authorial corpora are acts of canon-formation in miniature that indicate more foundational shifts in the way a culture views its literature and itself. By combining a theoretically-informed approach with a broad historical view of collected editions from the late eighteenth century to the present (including the rise of digital editions), Gailey fills a gap in the textual scholarship of the editing history of major figures like Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and of the American literary canon itself"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aDickinson, Emily,d1830-1886xAppreciation.10aWhitman, Walt,d1819-1892xAppreciation. 0aAmerican literaturexAppreciationzUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aAmerican literaturexAppreciationzUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aLiterature publishingzUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aLiterature publishingzUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aEditionszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aEditingzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aCanon (Literature) 0aAuthorshipxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aEditorial theory and literary criticism.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/etlc.13607061.0001.001

Elizabeth B. Bearden contends that monstrosity, as a precursor to modern concepts of disability, has much to teach about our tendency to inscribe disability with meaning. Understanding how early modern writers approached disability not only provides more accurate genealogies of disability, but also helps nuance current aesthetic and theoretical disability formulations. The book analyzes the cultural valences of early modern disability across a broad national and chronological span, attending to the specific bodily, spatial, and aesthetic systems that contributed to early modern literary representations of disability. The cross section of texts (including conduct books and treatises, travel writing and wonder books) is comparative, putting canonical European authors such as Castiglione into dialogue with transatlantic and Anglo-Ottoman literary exchange.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxSocial aspectsyEarly modern, 1500-1700. 0aHuman bodyxSocial aspectsyEarly modern, 1500-1700. 0aPeople with disabilities in literature. 0aPeople with disabilities in art. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aCorporealities.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10014355

This volume explores the complex relationship between decentralization and the welfare state to determine whether or not decentralization has negative consequences for welfare. The contributors examine a variety of federalist nations, including Spain, Canada, and the United Kingdom, interrogating key issues: (1) Are there regional welfare states (such as Scotland, Minnesota, etc.)? (2) How much variation is there in the structures of federal welfare states? (3) Is federalism bad for welfare? (4) Does austerity recentralize or decentralize welfare states? By focusing on money and policy instead of law and constitutional politics, this volume shows that federalism shapes regional governments and policies even when decentralization exists.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aWelfare state. 0aSocial policy. 4aElectronic books.1 aElliott, Heather,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9993201

Using her own fieldwork as a case study, Berman shows how hands-on work in the arts with learners of all ages and backgrounds can contribute to economic stability by developing new skills, as well as enhancing public health and gender justice within communities. Berman's work, and the community artwork her book documents, present the visual arts as a crucial channel for citizens to find their individual voices and to become agents for change in the arenas of human rights and democracy.1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivativesuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aArt and society. 0aArt and social action. 0aArt and societyzSouth Africa. 0aArt and social actionzSouth Africa.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan) 0aNew public scholarship.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9256315

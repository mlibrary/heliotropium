He contends that the next recession, certain to begin before the end of 1999, will reveal public policymakers' predictions of balanced budgets and millennial prosperity to be hubris of the highest order.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aUnited StatesxEconomic policyy1993-2001. 0aUnited StatesxEconomic policyy1981-1993. 0aGovernment spending policyzUnited States. 0aBudgetzUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.15199

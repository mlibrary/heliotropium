But are advocates correct that term limits ensure citizens dedicated to the common good--rather than self-serving career politicians--run government? Or does the enforced high rate of turnover undermine the legislature's ability to function? In Implementing Term Limits, Marjorie Sarbaugh-Thompson and Lyke Thompson bring thirteen years of intensive research and 460 interviews to assess changes since Michigan's implementation of term limits in 1993 and explore their implications. Paying special attention to term limits' institutional effects, they also consider legislative representation, political accountability, and the role of the bureaucracy and interest groups in state legislatures. Their thorough study suggests that legislators are less accessible to officials and that there is a larger gap between legislators and their voters. Moreover, legislators become much more politically ambitious after term limits and spend more time on political activities. The selection of top chamber leaders is complicated by newcomers' lack of knowledge about and experience working with the leaders they elect before being sworn in. As a result, term limits in Michigan fail to deliver on many of the "good government" promises that appeal to citizens. Implementing Term Limits makes a unique and valuable contribution to the debate over the best means by which to obtain truly democratic institutions"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aTerm limits (Public office)zMichigan. 0aLegislatorsxTerm of officezMichigan. 0aRepresentative government and representationzMichigan. 0aGovernment accountabilityzMichigan. 0aMichiganxPolitics and government. 4aElectronic books.1 aThompson, Lyke.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aLegislative politics & policy making.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.6505734

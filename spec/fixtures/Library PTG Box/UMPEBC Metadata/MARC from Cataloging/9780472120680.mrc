These literary experiments with early digital cultures from the 1990s comparatively retrace and speculate on the digital's transformative influence on prior understandings of the human, of social lives, and of individuals' relations to material lifeworlds, exploring the consequences of the apparent plasticity of the boundaries of the human, particularly for women, subaltern subjects, and others already considered liminally human. As these texts query the digital technics entering into textual practices, subjectivity, spatial practices and social networks, lived space, nation, and economic circulation, they reconceive their own literary print narrative methods and material modes of circulation in order to elaborate on unnoticed potentialities and limits of digital technics, providing a crucial means to reorient digital cultures of the present"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aExperimental fiction, AmericanxHistory and criticism. 0aLiterature and the InternetzUnited States. 0aHypertext fictionxHistory and criticism. 0aHuman body and technology in literature. 0aLiterature and technologyzUnited States. 0aAmerican fictionxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/dcbooks.12672514.0001.001

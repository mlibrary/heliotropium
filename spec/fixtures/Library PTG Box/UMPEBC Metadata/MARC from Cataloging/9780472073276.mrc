The four stories in this volume date from the first and second decades of Tanizaki's long career and reflect themes that appear throughout his work: exoticism, sexuality, sadomasochism, contrasts between traditional and modern societies, disparities between appearance and reality, the power of dreams, amorality, an interest in cinema, and a fascination with the techniques of storytelling. The stories--translated into English here for the first time--are: "The Strange Case of Tomoda and Matsunaga" ("Tomoda to Matsunaga no hanashi," 1926), "A Night in Qinhuai" ("Shinwai no yo," 1919), "The Magician" ("Majutsushi," 1917), and "Red Roofs" ("Akai yane," 1925)"--cProvided by publisher.0 aThe strange case of Tomoda and Matsunaga -- A night in Qinhuai -- The magician -- Red roofs.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aTanizaki, Jun'ichirō,d1886-1965vTranslations into English. 4aElectronic books.1 aMcCarthy, Paul,d1944-etranslator.1 aChambers, Anthony H.q(Anthony Hood),etranslator.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aMichigan monograph series in Japanese studies ;40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9325860

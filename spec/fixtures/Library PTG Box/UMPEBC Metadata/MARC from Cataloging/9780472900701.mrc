Robbins demonstrates how educators used stories that resisted dominant conventions and expectations about learners to navigate cultural differences. Using case studies of educational initiatives on behalf of African American women, Native American children, and the urban poor, Learning Legacies promotes the importance of knowledge grounded in the histories and cultures of the many racial and ethnic groups that have always comprised America's populace, underscoring the value of rich cultural knowledge in pedagogy by illustrating how creative teachers still draw on these learning legacies today"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aCulturally relevant pedagogyzUnited States. 0aEducationxBiographical methods. 0aWomen teacherszUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aNew public scholarship.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.4469010

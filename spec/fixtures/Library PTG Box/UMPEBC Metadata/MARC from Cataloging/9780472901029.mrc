Looking beyond relatively well-studied cities like Shanghai, these essays foreground cinema's relationship with imperialism and colonialism and emphasize the rapid development of cinema as a sociocultural institution. These essays examine where films were screened; how cinema-going as a social activity adapted from and integrated with existing social norms and practices; the extent to which Cantonese opera and other regional performance traditions were models for the development of cinematic conventions; the role foreign films played in the development of cinema as an industry in the Republican era; and much more.  aSponsored by Knowledge Unlatched1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 Unported licenseuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aMotion pictureszChinaxHistory. 0aMotion pictureszChinazHong KongxHistory. 0aMotion pictureszTaiwanxHistory. 0aMotion picture industryzChinaxHistory. 0aMotion picture industryzChinazHong KongxHistory. 0aMotion picture industryzTaiwanxHistory. 4aElectronic books.1 aYeh, Emilie Yueh-yu,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9731616

Since its inception, U-M has collected and preserved objects: biological and geological specimens; ethnographic and archaeological artifacts; photographs and artistic works; encyclopedia, textbooks, rare books, and documents; and many other items. These vast collections and libraries testify to an ambitious vision of the research university as a place where knowledge is accumulated, shared, and disseminated through teaching, exhibition, and publication. Today, 200 years after the university's founding, museums, libraries, and archives continue to be an important part of U-M, which maintains more than 20 distinct museums, libraries, and collections. Viewed from a historic perspective, they provide a window through which we can explore the transformation of the academy, its public role, and the development of scholarly disciplines over the last two centuries. Even as they speak to important facets of Michigan's history, many of these collections also remain essential to academic research, knowledge production, and object-based pedagogy. Moreover, the university's exhibitions and displays attract hundreds of thousands of visitors per year from the campus, regional, and global communities. Beautifully illustrated with color photographs of these world-renowned collections, this book will appeal to readers interested in the history of museums and collections, the formation of academic disciplines, and of course, the University of Michigan"--Provided by publisher.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.20aUniversity of MichiganxMuseumsxHistory.20aUniversity of Michigan.bLibraryxHistory.20aUniversity of MichiganxArchivesxHistory. 0aMuseumsxCollection managementzMichiganzAnn ArborxHistory. 0aCollection management (Libraries)zMichiganzAnn ArborxHistory. 0aArchiveszMichiganzAnn ArborxManagementxHistory. 0aCollege museumszMichiganzAnn ArborxHistory. 0aAcademic librarieszMichiganzAnn ArborxHistory. 0aLearning and scholarshipzMichiganxHistory. 0aMichiganxIntellectual life.20aBentley Historical Library. 4aElectronic books.1 aBarndt, Kerstin,eeditor.1 aSinopoli, Carla M.,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9207853

Author Mark Rice discusses the controversies that surrounded Worcester's use of evocative photography and demonstrates his lasting influence on dominant modes of ethnographic photography as seen in the pages of National Geographic and elsewhere"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aWorcester, Dean C.q(Dean Conant),d1866-1924.10aWorcester, Dean C.q(Dean Conant),d1866-1924xPolitical and social views. 0aColonial administratorszPhilippinesvBiography. 0aPhotographerszPhilippinesvBiography. 0aPhotographyxPolitical aspectszPhilippinesxHistory. 0aPhotography in ethnologyzPhilippinesxHistory. 0aPhilippinesxHistoryvPictorial works. 0aPhilippinesxColonizationxHistory. 0aUnited StatesxRelationszPhilippines. 0aPhilippinesxRelationszUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.4665344

Teaching History in the Digital Age serves as a guide for practitioners on how to fruitfully employ the transformative changes of digital media in the research, writing, and teaching of history. T. Mills Kelly synthesizes more than two decades of research in digital history, offering practical advice on how to make best use of the results of this synthesis in the classroom and new ways of thinking about pedagogy in the digital humanities"--cProvided by publisher.  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aHistoryxComputer-assisted instruction. 0aHistoryxStudy and teaching (Higher)xTechnological innovations. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aDigital humanities (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/dh.12146032.0001.001

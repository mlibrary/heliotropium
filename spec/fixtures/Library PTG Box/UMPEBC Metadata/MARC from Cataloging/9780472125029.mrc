From drag ballerinas to faux queens, and from butoh divas to the club mothers of modern dance, this book delves into four decades of drag dances on American stages, tracing the ways in which bodies can be imagined otherwise. Drag dances take us beyond glittery one-liners and into the spaces between gender norms. In these backstage histories, we see dancers who give their bodies over to other selves, opening up the category of realness. When realness becomes a practice, dancing can become a way of restaging the histories of bodies. The book maps out a drag politics of embodiment, connecting drag dances to queer hope, memory, and mourning. There are aging eIÃÄÃÅ&#x201e;&#x2014;ÃÅ&#x201e;&#x2014;‚ôØ&#x90;toiles, midnight shows, mystical seIÃÄÃÅ&#x201e;&#x2014;ÃÅ&#x201e;&#x2014;‚ôØ&#x90;ances, and all of the dust and velvet of divas in their dressing-rooms. But these forty years of drag dances are also a cultural history, including Mark Morris dancing the death of Dido in the shadow of AIDS, and the swans of Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo sketching an antiracist vision for ballet. Drawing on queer theory, dance history, and the embodied practices of dancers themselves, The Bodies of Others examines the ways in which drag dances undertake the work of a shared queer and trans politics. The book will be of interest to scholars and students working on performance, gender and sexuality, and embodiment.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aDrag showszUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aDrag showszUnited StatesxHistoryy21st century. 0aFemale impersonatorszUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aTriangulations.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.8783686

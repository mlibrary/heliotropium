This "engaged" poetry features a range of aesthetics and focuses on public topics from climate change, to the aftermath of recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, to the increasing corporatization of U.S. culture. The News from Poems brings together newly commissioned essays by eminent poets and scholars of poetry and serves as a companion volume to an earlier anthology of engaged poetry compiled by the editors. Essays by Bob Perelman, Steven Gould Axelrod, Tony Hoagland, Eleanor Wilner, and others reveal how recent poetry has redefined our ideas of politics, authorship, identity, and poetics. The volume showcases the diversity of contemporary American poetry, discussing mainstream and experimental poets, including some whose work has sparked significant controversy. These and other poets of our time, the volume suggests, are engaged not only with public events and topics but also with new ways of imagining subjectivity, otherness, and poetry itself"--cProvided by publisher.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAmerican poetryy21st centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aPolitics and literaturezUnited StatesxHistoryy21st century. 0aLiterature and societyzUnited StatesxHistoryy21st century. 0aPoetics. 4aElectronic books.1 aGray, Jeffrey,d1944-eeditor.1 aKeniston, Ann,d1961-eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9227505

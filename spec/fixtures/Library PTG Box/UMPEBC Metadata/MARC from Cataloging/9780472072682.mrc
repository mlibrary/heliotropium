This book aims to answer that question by looking at a number of inter-related histories, as well as evaluating a wide range of methods and practices from fields in the humanities, social sciences, and information sciences to determine what might constitute the work and the world of digital rhetoric. The advent of digital and networked communication technologies prompts renewed interest in basic questions such as 'what counts as a text?' and 'can traditional rhetoric operate in digital spheres or will it need to be revised? Or will we need to invent new rhetorical practices altogether?' Through examples and consideration of digital rhetoric theories, methods for both researching and making in digital rhetoric fields, and examples of digital rhetoric pedagogy, scholarship, and public performance, this book aims to provides a broad overview of digital rhetoric by investigating the histories and boundaries that arise from one version of a map of the emerging field, focusing on the theories that are taken up and revised by digital rhetoric scholars and practitioners, as well as the methods (both traditional and new) that can be used to both study digital rhetoric and to potentially make new forms that draw on digital rhetoric for their persuasive power"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aRhetoricxData processing. 0aRhetoricxStudy and teaching. 0aDigital media. 0aOnline authorship. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aDigital humanities (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/dh.13030181.0001.001

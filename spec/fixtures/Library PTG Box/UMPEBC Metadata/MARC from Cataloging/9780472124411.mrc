It exceeds one-quarter of the population and is the most diverse generation in U.S. history. Millennials grew up experiencing September 11, the global proliferation of the Internet and of smart phones, and the worst economic recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Their young adulthood has been marked by rates of unemployment and underemployment surpassing those of their parents and grandparents, making them the first generation in the modern era to have higher rates of poverty than their predecessors at the same age. The Politics of Millennials explores the factors that shape the Millennial generation's unique political identity, how this identity conditions political choices, and how this cohort's diversity informs political attitudes and beliefs. Few scholars have empirically identified and studied the political attitudes and policy preferences of Millennials, despite the size and influence of this generation. This book explores politics from a generational perspective, first, and then combines this with other group identities that include race and ethnicity to bring a new perspective to how we examine identity politics.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPolitical participationzUnited States. 0aGeneration YzUnited States. 4aElectronic books.1 aRoss, Ashley D.,d1981-eauthor.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher.0 iSupplement (work):aRouse, Stella M.,tPolitics of millennials.h1 online resource (50 digital images)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9526877

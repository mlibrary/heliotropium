The book's contributors offer new theorizations of human and nonhuman embodiments and their complex evolutions in our global present, in essays that explore how disability might be imagined as participant in the "complex elaboration of difference," rather than something gone awry in an otherwise stable process. This alternative approach to materiality sheds new light on the capacities that exist within the depictions of disability that the book examines, including Spider-Man, Of Mice and Men, and Bloodchild.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxSocial conditions. 0aDisability studies. 0aSociology of disability. 4aElectronic books.1 aMitchell, David T.,d1962-eeditor.1 aAntebi, Susan,eeditor.1 aSnyder, Sharon L.,d1963-eeditor.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aCorporealities.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9365129

During World War I, a motley group of teenaged amateurs, impoverished war refugees, and out- of- work Russian actors banded together to revolutionize the Yiddish stage. Achieving a most unlikely success through their productions, the Vilna Troupe (1915-36) would eventually go on to earn the attention of theatergoers around the world. Advancements in modern transportation allowed Yiddish theater artists to reach global audiences, traversing not only cities and districts but also countries and continents. The Vilna Troupe routinely performed in major venues that had never before allowed Jews, let alone Yiddish, upon their stages, and operated across a vast territory, a strategy that enabled them to attract unusually diverse audiences to the Yiddish stage and a precursor to the organizational structures and travel patterns that we see now in contemporary theater. Debra Caplan's history of the Troupe is rigorously researched, employing primary and secondary sources in multiple languages, and is engagingly written.  aDescription based on information provided by publisher20aVÃ£ilner trupe. 0aTraveling theaterxHistoryy20th century. 0aTheater, YiddishxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.1 iSupplement (work):aCaplan, Debra.h1 online resource (2 audio files, 3 video files, 35 digital images)tYiddish Empire.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9533320

In The Allure of Grammar, Doug Rutledge gathers insightful responses to the full range of Estes's work-from a review of her first chapbook to a reading of two poems appearing in her 2018 book, Parole-that approach these beautiful verbal objects with both intellectual rigor and genuine awe. In addition to presenting an overview of critical reactions to Estes's oevre, reviews by Langdon Hammer, Julianne Buchsbaum, and Christopher Spaide also provide a helpful context for approaching a poet who claims to distrust narrative. Original essays consider the craft of Estes's poetry and offer literary analysis. Ahren Warner uses line breaks to explore a postmodern analysis of Estes's work. Mark Irwin looks at her poetic structure. Lee Upton employs a feminist perspective to explore Estes's use of italics and to look at the way she uses dance as a poetic image. Doug Rutledge considers her relationship to Dante and to the literary tradition through her use of ekphrasis. An interview with Estes herself, in which she speaks of a poem as an "arranged place . . . where experience happens," adds her perspective to the mix, at turns resonating with and challenging her critics. The Allure of Grammar will be useful for teachers and students of creative writing interested in the craft of non-narrative poetry. Readers of contemporary poetry who already admire Estes will find this collection insightful, while those not yet familiar with her work will come away from these essays eager to seek out her books.  aDescription based on information from publisher.10aEstes, AngiexCriticism and interpretation. 0aAmerican poetryy20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aAmerican poetryy21st centuryxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aUnder discussion.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9962940

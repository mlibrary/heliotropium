This book seeks to expand our view of Brown's work, addressing his practices as a painter and composer as well as his collaborations with visual artists Alexander Calder, Robert Rauschenberg, and the American abstract expressionists. The essays collected here explore Brown's compositional methods and their historical place in depth: not only his influential experiments with open form composition and graphic notation, but his interest in collaboration, mixed media, and his engagement with the European avant-garde. The volume includes several short essays by Brown that shed new light on his relationships with colleagues and the ideas that drove his work.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aBrown, Earle,d1926-2002xCriticism and interpretation. 4aElectronic books.1 aKim, Rebecca Y.1 aBrown, Earle,d1926-2002.tProse works.kSelections.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9688443

Promises raise hopes that positive policy changes are possible, but people are generally skeptical of these promises. Party Mandates and Democracy reveals the extent to and conditions under which governments fulfill party promises during election campaigns. Contrary to conventional wisdom a majority of pledges-sometimes a large majority-are fulfilled in most countries, most of the time. The fulfillment of parties' election pledges is an essential part of the democratic process. This book is the first major, genuinely comparative study of promises across a broad range of countries and elections, including the United States, Canada, nine Western European countries, and Bulgaria. The book thus adds to the body of literature on the variety of outcomes stemming from alternative democratic institutions.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPolitical campaigns. 0aCampaign promises. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aNew comparative politics.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9796088

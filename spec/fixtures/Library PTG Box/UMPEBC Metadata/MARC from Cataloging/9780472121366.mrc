Poetry, whether self-consciously or not, has always thrived on the paradox of the distant in the immanent and the other in the self; as such, it is driven by both a metaphysical hunger and a resistance to metaphysical certainty. Hidden resources of being animate the language of the near, just as near things beckon from an elusive and inarticulate distance. Bond revalidates the role of poetry and, more broadly, of the poetic imagination as both models for and embodiments of a transfigurative process, an imperfectly mimetic yet ontological engendering of consciousness at the limits of a language that must--if cognizant of its psychological, ethical, and epistemological summons--honor that which lies beyond it."--Page 4 of cover.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAmerican poetryy21st century. 0aEssays. 0aPoetryxHistory and criticismy21st century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aPoets on poetry40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.8150518

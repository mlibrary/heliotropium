Alexander Anievas focuses on one particularly significant aspect of this story: the intersocietal or geosocial origins of the two world wars, and, more broadly, the confluence of factors behind the Thirty Years' Crisis between 1914 and 1945. Anievas presents the Thirty Years' Crisis as a result of the development of global capitalism with all its destabilizing social and geopolitical consequences, particularly the intertwined and co-constitutive nature of imperial rivalries, social revolutions, and anti-colonial struggles. Building on the theory of uneven and combined development, he unites geopolitical and sociological explanations into a single framework, thereby circumventing the analytical stalemate between primacy of domestic politics and primacy of foreign policy approaches"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aCapitalismxHistoryy20th century. 0aCapitalismxSocial aspects. 0aInternational economic relationsxHistoryy20th century. 0aWorld politicsy1900-1945. 0aGeopoliticsxHistoryy20th century. 0aSocial conflictxHistoryy20th century. 0aWorld War, 1914-1918xCauses. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xCauses. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aConfigurations (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.6487271

Steep economic decline in major industrialized cities like Detroit, Flint, and Pontiac have captured the attention of the national and international media, putting the spotlight on how state and local government has responded to these crises. This book provides a comprehensive analysis of Michigan's politics and government. Chapters elucidate the foundational aspects of the state's government (the Michigan Constitution and intergovernmental relations); its political institutions (the state legislature, governor, and court system); its politics (political parties and elections); and its public policy (transportation, education, and the economy). Throughout, these topics are enriched with detailed historical context, comparative analysis across state lines, coverage of relevant recent events, and projections for the future. An ideal fit for courses on state and local government, this thorough, well-written book will also appeal to readers simply interested in learning more about the inner workings of government in the Great Lakes State"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aMichiganxPolitics and government. 0aLocal governmentzMichigan. 4aElectronic books.1 aKlemanski, John S.,eeditor.1 aDulio, David A.,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9697501

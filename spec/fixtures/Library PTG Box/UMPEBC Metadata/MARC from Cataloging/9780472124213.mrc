Gathering a decade of his writing on poetry, he widens our sense of poetry as a way of being in the world, proposing that poems can offer a permeability to marginalized voices and a shelter from the imperial noise and despair that can silence us. The Sound of Listening ranges between expansive surveys of the poetry of 9/11, Arab American poetry, documentary poetry, landscape poetry, installation poetry, and peace poetry; personal explorations of poets such as Adrienne Rich, Khalil Gibran, Lev Rubinstein, and Arseny Tarkovsky; and intimate dialogues with Randa Jarrar, Fady Joudah, and Micah Cavaleri, that illuminate Metres's practice of listening in his 2015 work, Sand Opera.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPolitics and literature. 0aPolitics in literature. 0aPolitical poetryxHistory and criticism. 0aProtest poetryxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher. 0aPoets on poetry.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9949963

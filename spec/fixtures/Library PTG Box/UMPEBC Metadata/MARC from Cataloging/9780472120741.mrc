In these ambitious, bustling essays, McSweeney resituates poetry as a medium amid media; hosts "strange meetings" of authors, texts, and artworks across the boundaries of genre, period, and nation; and examines such epiphenomena as translation, anachronism, and violence. Through readings of artists as diverse as Wilfred Owen, Andy Warhol, Harryette Mullen, Roberto Bolano, Aime Cesaire, and Georges Bataille, The Necropastoral shows by what strategies art persists amid lethal conditions as a spectacular, uncanny force"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPoetics. 0aExperimental poetryy21st centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aPoetryy21st centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aPoetryy20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aPoets on poetry40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.7573327

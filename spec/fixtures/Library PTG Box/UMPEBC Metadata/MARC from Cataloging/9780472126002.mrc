Based on Cheers!, Lester Graham and Tammy Coxen's popular cocktail segment on Michigan Radio (NPR), this book gathers 45 of the authors' favorite cocktail recipes celebrating the Great Lakes State--its history, its people, its culture, even its weather! Throughout, the authors mix in dashes of Michigan's fascinating drinking history, entertaining profiles of award-winning cocktail bars, distilleries, and individual spirits from the region, as well as helpful tidbits for preparing top-shelf cocktails on your own. Learn how to mix a Bullshot, the Detroit-born cocktail containing Campbell's Beef Broth -- Marilyn Monroe famously called the drink "a horrible thing to do to vodka." Or try out the authors' Whiskey Sour recipe honoring the true story of Valentine Goesaert, a Dearborn woman who challenged the constitutionality of a Michigan law prohibiting female bartenders and in 1948 took her case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Whether you're a fan of whiskey, gin, or vodka -- of the latest cocktail trends or all-time classic drinks -- there's something in this book for all tastes. What's constant is that each drink showcases a uniquely Michigan twist, making this book perfect for anyone who loves the state, its history and culture, or simply the delicious, delightful, and distinctive cocktails it has inspired.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aCocktailszMichigan. 0aAlcoholic beverageszMichigan. 0aDrinking of alcoholic beverageszMichigan. 0aDistillerieszMichigan. 0aBars (Drinking establishments)zMichigan. 0aRadio programszMichigan. 4aElectronic books.1 aGraham, Lester,eauthor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11330882

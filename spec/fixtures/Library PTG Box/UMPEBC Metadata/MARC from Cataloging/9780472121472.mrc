He finds in the quality of ecstatic utterance his passport to regions where reason and logic fail and the only knowledge is instinctual, in physical existence and breath. This collection includes Ali's essays on topics such as Anne Carson's translations of Euripides; the poetry and politics of Mahmoud Darwish; Josey Foo's poetry/dance collaborations with choreographer Leah Stein; Olga Broumas' collaboration with T. Begley; Jorie Graham's complication of Kenneth Goldsmith's theories; the postmodern spirituality of the 14th century Kashmiri mystic poet Lalla; translations of Homer, Mandelstam, Sappho, and Hafez; as well as the poet Reetika Vazirani's practice of yoga.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPoetryxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aPoets on poetry40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.8252696

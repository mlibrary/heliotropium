It historicizes and analyzes widely disseminated Pepsi commercials for its signature and diet colas, focusing largely on well-known television spots and charting their evolution from featuring stand-alone, broadcast jingles to celebrities singing the latest pop songs and styles in its campaigns. This book integrates close musical analysis with interdisciplinary scholarship on advertising and American popular culture to examine the process of redaction -- the practice marketers have used to select, censor, and restructure musical texts to fit commercial contexts in ways that revise their aesthetic meanings and serve corporate aims. It argues that it was advertising's ability to get inside musical texts that eventually allowed corporate brands to play key roles in popular music's dissemination and production. This book investigates how Pepsi-Cola marketing has historically appropriated meanings from hit songs and celebrity musical endorsers, what new meanings its well-known spots attempted to emit, and why these commercials shaped future relationships between the American music business, the advertising industry, and corporate brands.  aDescription based on information from publisher.20aPepsi-Cola Company.20aPepsiCo, Inc. 0aCola drinksxMarketing. 0aTelevision commercialszUnited States. 0aTelevision advertisingzUnited States. 0aAdvertisingxBrand name products. 0aPopular musiczUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aTracking pop series.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9536286

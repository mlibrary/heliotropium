Thebook covers the full fifty-year history of the Beach Boys' music, from essays on some of the group's best-known music-such as their hitsingle "Good Vibrations"-to their mythical unfinished masterpiece, Smile. Throughout, the book places special focus on the individual whose creative vision brought the whole enterprise to life, Brian Wilson,advancing our understanding of his gifts as a songwriter, arranger, and producer. The book joins a growing body of literature on the popular music of the1960s, in general, and on Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys in particular. But Good Vibrations extends the investigation further and deeper than it has gone before, not only offering new understanding and insights into individual songs and albums, but also providing close examination of compositional techniques and reflections on the group's place in American popular culture.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aWilson, Brian,d1942-xCriticism and interpretation. 0aPopular musiczUnited StatesxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.1 aLambert, Philip,d1958-2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aTracking pop40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9275965

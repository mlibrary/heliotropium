During this time period, the majority party in the Senate switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party without the changes in other variables that usually accompany such an event, such as a change in president, congressmen, or political issues. In what the authors term the "Jeffords switch", Senator Jim Jeffords left the Republican Party in May 2001 and switched to being an independent. Because he agreed to vote with the Democratic Party on organizational votes, this gave the Democrats the 51-49 majority in the Senate. As a result of this rare turn of events, the authors are able to compare the data from before and after the switch in a quasi-experiment, while controlling the other variables in a way that would not be possible in a long-term study. Using the case of "Jeffords switch",  Chris Den Hartog and Nathan W. Monroe examine how power is shared and transferred in the Senate, as well as whether Democratic bills became more successful after the switch. They also utilize the data after the switch, when the Republican Party still held a majority on many Democratic Party-led committees, to examine the power of the committee chairs to influence decisions. While the authors find that the majority party does influences Senate decisions, they are much more interested in exploring the method and limits of the majority party to achieve its goals.  aDescription based on information from publisher.10aUnited States.bCongress.bSenatevHistory. 0aParty affiliationzUnited States.10aJeffords, James M. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty2001- 4aElectronic books.1 aMonroe, Nathan W.,eauthor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aLegislative politics & policy making.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1013930102455nam  2200397Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204024003000233050001000263100003000273245013000303246008500433246004900518246005300567264010000620264001000720300002200730336002600752337002600778338003600804504004100840520087500881588005301756650001901809650001901828655002201847700003101869710006501900856009201965on108117424020190108113731.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190108t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124633qelectronic book  a0472124633qelectronic book  z9780472131174qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.99932012doi 4aJC4791 aGreer, Scott L.,eeditor.10aFederalism and social policy :bpatterns of redistribution in 11 democracies /cEdited by Scott L.

This volume explores the complex relationship between decentralization and the welfare state to determine whether or not decentralization has negative consequences for welfare. The contributors examine a variety of federalist nations, including Spain, Canada, and the United Kingdom, interrogating key issues: (1) Are there regional welfare states (such as Scotland, Minnesota, etc.)? (2) How much variation is there in the structures of federal welfare states? (3) Is federalism bad for welfare? (4) Does austerity recentralize or decentralize welfare states? By focusing on money and policy instead of law and constitutional politics, this volume shows that federalism shapes regional governments and policies even when decentralization exists.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aWelfare state. 0aSocial policy. 4aElectronic books.1 aElliott, Heather,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.999320102535nam  2200349Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204024003000233035002200263043001200285050001300297245010900310264006400419264001000483300004900493336002600542337002600568338003600594504004100630520125400671588005301925650003101978655002202009710006202031856009202093on107905852720181217114715.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181217t20192019miua    ob    001 0 eng    aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472125319qelectronic book  a0472125311qelectronic book  z9780472131402qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.95617512doi  a(OCoLC)1079058527  aaz----- 4aQA76.57500aGlobal digital cultures :bperspectives from South Asia/cAswin Punathambekar and Sriram Mohan, editors. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019. 4c√2019  a1 online resource (304 pages)billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aDigital media histories are part of a global network, and South Asia is a key nexus in shaping the trajectory of digital media in the twenty-first century. Digital platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and others are deeply embedded in the daily lives of millions of people around the world, shaping how people engage with others as kin, as citizens, and as consumers. Moving away from Anglo-American and strictly national frameworks, the essays in this book explore the intersections of local, national, regional, and global forces that shape contemporary digital culture(s) in regions like South Asia: the rise of digital and mobile media technologies, the ongoing transformation of established media industries, and emergent forms of digital media practice and use that are reconfiguring sociocultural, political, and economic terrains across the Indian subcontinent. From massive state-driven digital identity projects and YouTube censorship to Tinder and dating culture, from Twitter and primetime television to Facebook and political rumors, Global Digital Cultures focuses on enduring concerns of representation, identity, and power while grappling with algorithmic curation and data-driven processes of production, circulation, and consumption.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aDigital mediazSouth Asia. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.956175103252nam  2200349Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204024003000233035002200263050001000285100003300295245007000328264006400398264001000462300005100472336002600523337002600549338003600575504004100611520196600652588005302618650005502671655002202726710006202748856009202810on107905852620181217114715.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181217t20192019miua    ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472125289qelectronic book  a0472125281qelectronic book  z9780472131396qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.95148252doi  a(OCoLC)1079058526 4aDD1371 aWangerin, Laura E.,eauthor.10aKingship and Justice in the Ottonian Empire /cLaura E.

Wangerin challenges traditional views of the Ottonian Empire's rulership. Drawing from a broad array of sources including royal and imperial diplomas, manuscript illuminations, and histories, Ottonian kingship and the administration of justice are investigated using traditional historical and comparative methodologies as well as through the application of innovative approaches such as modern systems theories. This study suggests that distinctive elements of the Ottonians' governing apparatus, such as its decentralized structure, emphasis on the royal iter, and delegation of authority, were essential features of a highly developed political system. Kingship and Justice in the Ottonian Empire provides a welcome addition to English-language scholarship on the Ottonians, as well as to scholarship dealing with rulership and medieval legal studies. Scholars have recognized the importance of ritual and symbolic behaviors in the Ottonian political sphere, while puzzling over the apparent lack of administrative organization, a contradiction between what we know about the Ottonians as successful rulers and their traditional characterization as rulers of a disorganized polity. Trying to account for the apparent disparity between their political and military achievements, cultural and artistic efflorescence, and relative dynastic stability, which seemingly accompanied a disinterest in writing law or creating a centralized hierarchical administration, is a tension that persists in the scholarship. This book argues that far from being accidental successes or employing primitive methods of governance, the Ottonians were shrewd rulers and administrators who exploited traditional methods of conflict resolution and delegated jurisdictional authority to keep control over their vast empire. Thus, one of the important things that this book aims to accomplish is to challenge our preconceived notions of what successful government looks like.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aHoly Roman EmpirexHistoryxSaxon House, 919-1024. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.951482502832nam  2200409Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204020002900233024003000262035002200292043001200314050001100326100003000337245009200367264006400459264001000523300005100533336002600584337002600610338003600636504005100672520128000723588005302003650005002056650003702106650007002143650003302213655002202246710006202268856009202330on107905852520181217114715.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181217t20192019miua    ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124183qelectronic book  a0472124188qelectronic book  z9780472053926qpaperback  z9780472073924qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.92710942doi  a(OCoLC)1079058525  an-us--- 4aHV94711 aJacobsen, Carol,eauthor.10aFor dear life :bwomen's decriminalization and human rights in focus /cCarol Jacobsen. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019. 4c√2019  a1 online resource (198 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aFor Dear Life chronicles feminist and artist Carol Jacobsen'deep commitment to the causes of justice and human rights, and focuses a critical lens on an American criminal-legal regime that imparts racist, gendered, and classist modes of punishment to women lawbreakers. Jacobsen's tireless work with and for women prisoners is charted in this rich assemblage of images and texts that reveal the collective strategies she and the prisoners have employed to receive justice. The book gives evidence that women's lawbreaking is often an effort to survive gender-based violence. The faces, letters, and testimonies of dozens of incarcerated women with whom Jacobsen has worked present a visceral yet politicized chorus of voices against the criminal-legal systems that fail us all. Their voices are joined by those of leading feminist scholars in essays that illuminate the arduous methods of dissent that Jacobsen and the others have employed to win freedom for more than a dozen women sentenced to life imprisonment, and to free many more from torturous prison conditions. The book is a document to Jacobsen's love and lifelong commitment to creating feminist justice and freedom, and to the efficacy of her artistic, legal, and extralegal political actions on behalf of women.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aWomen prisonersxCivil rightszUnited States. 0aFemale offenderszUnited States. 0aDiscrimination in criminal justice administrationzUnited States. 0aHuman rightszUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.927109403513nam  2200493Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020003100204020002800235020002900263020002900292024003000321035002200351050001200373245011700385246006300502246002100565264006500586264001000651300003400661336002600695337002600721338003600747504004100783520155800824536007202382542015002454588006002604630002902664650002402693650001002717650002102727650003002748655002202778700003302800700003202833710006202865856009202927on107777375020181205010606.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181205t20192019miu     ob    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengepnerdacEYMdEYM  a9780472125272qelectronic book  a0472125273qelectronic book  a9780472901098qopen access  a0472901095qopen access  z9780472074150qhardcover  z9780472054152qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.96970412doi  a(OCoLC)1077773750 4aHM533.500a#identity :bhashtagging race, gender, sexuality, and nation /cAbigail De Kosnik and Keith P.

It has empowered minoritarian groups to organize protests, articulate often-underrepresented perspectives, and form community. It has also spread hashtags that have been used to bully and silence women, people of color, and LGBTQ people. #identity is among the first scholarly books to address the positive and negative effects of Twitter on our contemporary world. Hailing from diverse scholarly fields, all contributors are affiliated with The Color of New Media, a scholarly collective based at the University of California, Berkeley. The Color of New Media explores the intersections of new media studies, critical race theory, gender and women's studies, and postcolonial studies. The essays in #identity consider topics such as the social justice movements organized through #BlackLivesMatter, #Ferguson, and #SayHerName; the controversies around #WhyIStayed and #CancelColbert; Twitter use in India and Africa; the integration of hashtags such as #nohomo and #onfleek that have become part of everyday online vernacular; and other ways in which Twitter has been used by, for, and against women, people of color, LGBTQ, and Global South communities. Collectively, the essays in this volume offer a critically interdisciplinary view of how and why social media has been at the heart of U.S. and global political discourse for over a decade."  aSponsored by the Library of the University of California, Berkeley.1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial 4.0 Unported licenseuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/  aDescription based on information provided by publisher.00aTwitterxSocial aspects. 0aHashtags (Metadata) 0aRace. 0aGender identity. 0aNational characteristics. 4aElectronic books.1 aDe Kosnik, Abigail,eeditor.1 aFeldman, Keith P.,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.969704102963nam  2200469Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204024003100233035002200264043001200286050001100298245015600309264006400465300005200529336002600581337002600607338003600633490005000669504005100719520102500770588005301795650002301848650004001871650002601911650002601937651005401963650005102017655002202068700002502090700003302115700003202148710006502180770010402245830005102349856009302400on107777369520181205010629.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181205s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472125012qelectronic book  a047212501Xqelectronic book  z9780472131280qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.100873032doi  a(OCoLC)1077773695  as-ag--- 4aJL209200aCampaigns and voters in developing democracies :bArgentina in comparative perspective /cedited by Noam Lupu, Virginia Oliveros, and Luis Schiumerini. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (279 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aWeiser Center for Emerging Democracies series  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aVoting behavior is informed by the experience of advanced democracies, yet the electoral context in developing democracies is significantly different. Civil society is often weak, poverty and inequality high, political parties ephemeral and attachments to them weak, corruption rampant, and clientelism widespread. Voting decisions in developing democracies follow similar logics to those in advanced democracies in that voters base their choices on group affiliation, issue positions, valence considerations, and campaign persuasion. Yet developing democracies differ in the weight citizens assign to these considerations. Where few social identity groups are politically salient and partisan attachments are sparse, voters may place more weight on issue voting. Where issues are largely absent from political discourse, valence considerations and campaign effects play a larger role. Campaigns and Voters in Developing Democracies develops a theoretical framework to specify why voter behavior differs across contexts.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aVotingzArgentina. 0aPolitical participationzArgentina. 0aElectionszArgentina. 0aDemocracyzArgentina. 0aArgentinaxPolitics and governmenty21st century. 0aDeveloping countriesxPolitics and government. 4aElectronic books.1 aLupu, Noam,eeditor.1 aOliveros, Virginia,eeditor.1 aSchiumerini, Luis,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.08iSupplement (work):tCampaigns and voters in developing democracies.h1 online resource (1 appendix) 0aWeiser Center for Emerging Democracies series.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1008730303200nam a2200421Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204020002900233024003000262035002200292043001200314050001100326100004000337245012300377264006500500264001000565300003500575336002600610337002600636338003600662490002500698504006700723520162200790588005302412650002502465650002002490651003202510655002202542710006502564830005702629856009202686on107627408620181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472125258qelectronic book  a0472125257qelectronic book  z9780472074143qhardcover  z9780472054145qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.99896032doi  a(OCoLC)1076274086  af-za--- 4aLC10911 aHern, Erin Accampo,d1987-eauthor.10aDeveloping states, shaping citizenship :bservice delivery and political participation in Zambia /cErin Accampo Hern. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (217 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aAfrican perspectives  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 202-217) and index.3 aAt the nexus of political science, development studies, and public policy, Developing States, Shaping Citizenship analyzes an overlooked driver of political behavior: citizens' past experience with the government through service provision. Using evidence from Zambia, this book demonstrates that the quality of citizens' interactions with the government through service provision sends them important signals about what they can hope to gain from political action. These interactions influence not only formal political behaviors like voting, but also collective behavior, political engagement, and subversive behaviors like tax evasion. Lack of capacity for service delivery not only undermines economic growth and human development, but also citizens' confidence in the responsiveness of the political system. Absent this confidence, citizens are much less likely to participate in democratic processes, express their preferences, or comply with state revenue collection. Economic development and political development in low-capacity states, Hern argues, are concurrent processes. Erin Accampo Hern draws on original data from an original large-N survey, interviews, Afrobarometer data, and archival materials collected over 12 months in Zambia. The theory underlying this book's framework is that of policy feedback, which argues that policies, once in place, influence the subsequent political participation of the affected population. This theory has predominantly been applied to advanced industrial democracies, and this book is the first explicit effort to adapt the theory to the developing country context.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aCitizenshipzZambia. 0aCivicszZambia. 0aZambiaxPolitical activity. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aAfrican perspectives (University of Michigan.

Great Lakes Rocks takes readers on this fascinating journey through geologic history, beginning with an investigation of the surface features-the hills and valleys, waterfalls and caves, and the Great Lakes themselves-encountered on a daily basis. As the book digs deeper into the past, readers learn about the amazing techniques geologists have used to reconstruct the events that shaped this region millions and even billions of years before humans set foot on Earth. Throughout, the book gives special attention to the link between the region's geology and its modern history, including the impacts of geology on settlement patterns, the development of industries, and the present-day economy. Other discussed topics include natural hazards that are geologic in nature, including earthquakes, floods, landslides, and coastal erosion, as well as information on rocks, minerals, and ancient life seen in fossils. Written for nonspecialist readers, this book provides a detailed but easy-to- follow introduction to the geology of the Great Lakes region, and it is an ideal fit for introductory geology courses, including those aimed at nonscience majors.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aGeologyzGreat Lakes Region (North America) 0aGreat Lakes Region (North America)xHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.943761602924nam a2200385Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204024003000233035002200263043001200285050001500297100003300312245014900345264006500494264001000559300004500569336002600614337002600640338003600666504007800702520137900780588005302159650004202212650006102254651004402315655002202359710006502381856009202446on107627412320181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472125173qelectronic book  a0472125176qelectronic book  z9780472131310qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.98004402doi  a(OCoLC)1076274123  an-us--- 4aJK 723 .E91 aLantis, Jeffrey S.,eauthor.10aForeign policy advocacy and entrepreneurship :bhow a new generation in Congress is shaping U.S. engagement with the world /cJeffrey S.

It explores original case studies of eight U.S. policy-makers who challenged authority during the Obama administration-from war veterans and fundamentalist Christian activists to former spies and minority legislators. Newly elected representatives in both parties dove into issues that sometimes seem well beyond the interests of their constituents and that defy their own party leadership. Junior entrepreneurs have employed a combination of formal legislative strategies for successful influence and informal networking, policy narratives, and communication strategies. While some congressional initiatives have succeeded in changing U.S. foreign policy and others have failed, a new generation of legislators appears to be gaining greater influence over U.S. foreign policy in the polarized atmosphere of Washington, D.C. Entrepreneurship by junior members of Congress represent a puzzle for traditional foreign policy studies that focus on seniority, party discipline, and the rigid institutional systems on Capitol Hill. By melding entrepreneurship and policy advocacy literature, this book advances a new typology of foreign policy entrepreneurship, recognizing the impact of multidimensional strategies of influence.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aGovernment executiveszUnited States. 0aPolitical entrepreneurshipzUnited Statesy21st century. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationsy2017- 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.980044003185nam a2200409Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020002900137020003500166020003200201024003000233035002200263043001200285050001600297100002600313245008500339264006500424264001000489300003500499336002600534337002600560338003600586490002000622504006700642520160600709588005302315650005302368650006902421650008602490655002202576710006502598830002002663856009202683on107627412420181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  z9780472131297qhardcover  a9780472125074qelectronic book  a0472125079qelectronic book7 a10.3998/mpub.94503462doi  a(OCoLC)1076274124  an-us--- 4aPS 173 .D651 aMattis, Ann,eauthor.10aDirty work :bdomestic service in progressive-era women's fiction /cAnn Mattis. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (221 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aClass : culture  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 206-221) and index.3 aDirty Work sheds light on the complex relationships between women employers and their household help in the early 20th century through their representations in literature, including women's magazines, conduct manuals, and particularly female-authored fiction. Domestic service brought together women from different classes, races, and ethnicities, and with it, a degree of social anxiety as upwardly mobile young women struggled to construct their identities in a changing world. The book focuses on the works of Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Edith Wharton, Gertrude Stein, Nella Larsen, Jessie Fauset, Anzia Yezierska, and Fannie Hurst and their various depictions of the maid/mistress relationship, revealing "a feminized and racialized brand of class hegemony." Not only did modern servants become configured as racial, hygienic, and social threats to the emergent ideal of the nuclear family, they played critical rhetorical roles in first-wave feminism and the New Negro movements. Dirty Work argues that these racial and class conflicts fundamentally shaped modern American domesticity, femininity, and fiction by female authors of the period. Deploying a materialist feminist and new modernist approach, and examining a diverse archive of modern American texts, including home economics pamphlets, undercover journalism, autobiography, reform tracts, training manuals, experimental modernism, and gothic fiction, Mattis reveals how U.S. domestic service was the political unconscious of cultural narratives that attempted to define modern domesticity and progressive femininity in monolithic terms.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aHousehold employees in literaturey20th century. 0aWomen household employeesxIn literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aAfrican American women household employeesxIn literaturexHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aClass, culture.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.945034603095nam a2200385Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204024003000233035002200263050001200285100002900297245009100326264006500417264001000482300003500492336002600527337002600553338003600579490002100615520165500636588005302291600004802344650005802392650005802450655002202508710006502530830002202595856009202617on107627406020181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126t20192019miu     o     000 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472125067qelectronic book  a0472125060qelectronic book  z9780472037377qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.99629402doi  a(OCoLC)1076274060 4aPS 35551 aRutledge, Doug,eeditor.14aThe allure of grammar :bthe glamour of Angie Estes's poetry /cDoug Rutledge, editor. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (144 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aUnder discussion  aOf Angie Estes, the poet and critic Stephanie Burt has written that she "has created some of the most beautiful verbal objects in the world." In The Allure of Grammar, Doug Rutledge gathers insightful responses to the full range of Estes's work-from a review of her first chapbook to a reading of two poems appearing in her 2018 book, Parole-that approach these beautiful verbal objects with both intellectual rigor and genuine awe. In addition to presenting an overview of critical reactions to Estes's oevre, reviews by Langdon Hammer, Julianne Buchsbaum, and Christopher Spaide also provide a helpful context for approaching a poet who claims to distrust narrative. Original essays consider the craft of Estes's poetry and offer literary analysis. Ahren Warner uses line breaks to explore a postmodern analysis of Estes's work. Mark Irwin looks at her poetic structure. Lee Upton employs a feminist perspective to explore Estes's use of italics and to look at the way she uses dance as a poetic image. Doug Rutledge considers her relationship to Dante and to the literary tradition through her use of ekphrasis. An interview with Estes herself, in which she speaks of a poem as an "arranged place . . . where experience happens," adds her perspective to the mix, at turns resonating with and challenging her critics. The Allure of Grammar will be useful for teachers and students of creative writing interested in the craft of non-narrative poetry. Readers of contemporary poetry who already admire Estes will find this collection insightful, while those not yet familiar with her work will come away from these essays eager to seek out her books.  aDescription based on information from publisher.10aEstes, AngiexCriticism and interpretation. 0aAmerican poetryy20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aAmerican poetryy21st centuryxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aUnder discussion.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.996294003059nam a22004213i 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204020002900233024003000262035002200292043001200314050001100326100003500337245008500372264006500457264001000522300003500532336002600567337002600593338003600619490006600655504006700721520144800788588005302236650005402289650005402343650004102397655002202438710006502460830002002525856009202545on107627433520181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472125029qelectronic book  a0472125028qelectronic book  z9780472074099qhardcover  z9780472054091qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.87836862doi  a(OCoLC)1076274335  an-us--- 4aPN19691 aSchwartz, Selby Wynn,eauthor.14aThe bodies of others :bdrag dances and their afterlives /cSelby Wynn Schwartz. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (260 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aTriangulations : lesbian/gay/queer--theater/drama/performance  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 230-258) and index.3 aThe Bodies of Others explores the politics of gender in motion. From drag ballerinas to faux queens, and from butoh divas to the club mothers of modern dance, this book delves into four decades of drag dances on American stages, tracing the ways in which bodies can be imagined otherwise. Drag dances take us beyond glittery one-liners and into the spaces between gender norms. In these backstage histories, we see dancers who give their bodies over to other selves, opening up the category of realness. When realness becomes a practice, dancing can become a way of restaging the histories of bodies. The book maps out a drag politics of embodiment, connecting drag dances to queer hope, memory, and mourning. There are aging eIÃÄÃÅ&#x201e;&#x2014;‚Ñóƒêtoiles, midnight shows, mystical seIÃÄÃÅ&#x201e;&#x2014;‚Ñóƒêances, and all of the dust and velvet of divas in their dressing-rooms. But these forty years of drag dances are also a cultural history, including Mark Morris dancing the death of Dido in the shadow of AIDS, and the swans of Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo sketching an antiracist vision for ballet. Drawing on queer theory, dance history, and the embodied practices of dancers themselves, The Bodies of Others examines the ways in which drag dances undertake the work of a shared queer and trans politics. The book will be of interest to scholars and students working on performance, gender and sexuality, and embodiment.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aDrag showszUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aDrag showszUnited StatesxHistoryy21st century. 0aFemale impersonatorszUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aTriangulations.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.878368602672nam a2200385Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204024003000233035002200263043001200285050001000297100003000307245014200337264006400479300005200543336002600595337002600621338003600647504005100683520111300734588005301847650003701900650003101937655002201968700003301990710006502023770010602088856009202194on107627463820181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124657qelectronic book  a047212465Xqelectronic book  z9780472131198qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.99930242doi  a(OCoLC)1076274638  an-us--- 4aJF4941 aDyck, Joshua J.,eauthor.10aInitiatives without engagement :ba realistic appraisal of direct democracy's secondary effects /cJoshua J.

When political scientists began to examine whether the state ballot initiative process had spillover consequences, they found the initiative process had a positive impact on civic engagement. Recent scholarship casts doubt on these conclusions, determining the ballot initiative process in fact did not make people believe they could influence the political process, trust the government, or be more knowledgeable about politics. However, in some circumstances, it got them to show up at the polls, and increased interest groups' participation in the political arena. In this book, Dyck and Lascher develop and test a theory that can explain evidence that the ballot initiative process fails to provide the civic benefits commonly claimed for it, and evidence that it increases political participation. This theory argues that the basic function of direct democracy is to create more conflict in society.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aDirect democracyzUnited States. 0aReferendumzUnited States. 4aElectronic books.1 aLascher, Edward L.,eauthor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.08iSupplement (work):aDyck, Joshua J.,tInitiatives without engagement.h1 online resource (1 appendix)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.999302403330nam a2200421Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204020002900233024003100262035002200293043001200315050001300327245011600340264006400456300005200520336002600572337002600598338003600624490005100660504005100711520165900762588005302421651003902474651003902513651004402552651004402596655002202640700003602662710006502698830005202763856009302815on107627463920181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472125159qelectronic book  a047212515Xqelectronic book  z9780472074129qhardcover  z9780472054121qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.100279002doi  a(OCoLC)1076274639  aa-ko--- 4aDS922.2700aRevisiting Minjung :bnew perspectives on the cultural history of 1980s South Korea /cedited by Sunyoung Park. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (285 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aComparative perspectives on contemporary Korea  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aAn epoch-marking alliance of laborers, students, dissident intellectuals, and ordinary citizens was at the heart of South Korea's transformation from a dictatorship into a vibrant democracy during the 1980s. Collectively known as the minjung ("the people"), these agents of Korean democratization historically carved out an expanded role for civil society in the country's politics. In Revisiting Minjung, some of the foremost experts in 1980s Korean history, literature, film, art, and music provide new insights into one of the most crucial decades in South Korean history. Drawing from the theoretical perspectives of transnationalism, post-Marxist studies, intersectional feminism, popular culture studies, and more, the volume demonstrates how an era that is often associated with radical politics was, in effect, the catalyst for the subsequent flourishing of democratic and liberal values in South Korea. Revisiting Minjung brings new themes, new subjectivities, and new theoretical perspectives to the study of the rich ecosystem of 1980s Korean culture. Treated here is a wide array of topics, including the origins of minjung ideology, its critique by the right wing, minjung art and music, workers' literary culture, women writers and the resurgence of feminism, erotic cinema, science fiction, transnational political travels, and the representations of race and queerness in 1980s popular culture. The book thus details the origins and development of some of the movements that shape cultural life in South Korea today, and it does so through analyses that engage some of the most pressing debates in current scholarship in Korea and abroad.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aKorea (South)xHistoryy1960-1988. 0aKorea (South)xHistoryy1988-2002. 0aKorea (South)xCivilizationy1960-1988. 0aKorea (South)xCivilizationy1988-2002. 4aElectronic books.1 aPark, Sunyoung,d1971-eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aComparative perspectives on contemporary Korea.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1002790002365nam a2200421Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204020002900233024003000262035002200292050001100314245013700325264006400462300005200526336002600578337002600604338003600630490004500666504005100711520072000762588005301482650004901535650002401584650002901608655002201637700004001659700002801699700003901727710006501766830002001831856009201851on107627464020181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472125098qelectronic book  a0472125095qelectronic book  z9780472074112qhardcover  z9780472054114qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.93651292doi  a(OCoLC)1076274640 4aHV156804aThe matter of disability :bmateriality, biopolitics, crip effect /cDavid T.

The book's contributors offer new theorizations of human and nonhuman embodiments and their complex evolutions in our global present, in essays that explore how disability might be imagined as participant in the "complex elaboration of difference," rather than something gone awry in an otherwise stable process. This alternative approach to materiality sheds new light on the capacities that exist within the depictions of disability that the book examines, including Spider-Man, Of Mice and Men, and Bloodchild.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxSocial conditions. 0aDisability studies. 0aSociology of disability. 4aElectronic books.1 aMitchell, David T.,d1962-eeditor.1 aAntebi, Susan,eeditor.1 aSnyder, Sharon L.,d1963-eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aCorporealities.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.936512903410nam a2200421Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204024003000233035002200263043001200285050001300297245009500310264006400405300005200469336002600521337002600547338003600573490002400609504005100633520186500684588005302549610002302602610001302625610002402638650005602662650004602718655002202764700002702786710006502813830001802878856009202896on107627464120181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124848qelectronic book  a0472124846qelectronic book  z9780472074082qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.94507832doi  a(OCoLC)1076274641  ae-uk-en 4aML421.B404aThe Beatles through a glass onion :breconsidering the White Album /cMark Osteen, editor. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (298 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aTracking pop series  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aThe Beatles, the 1968 double LP more commonly known as the White Album, has always been viewed as an oddity in the group's oeuvre. Many have found it to be inconsistent, sprawling, and self-indulgent. The Beatles through a Glass Onion: Reconsidering the White Album is the first-ever scholarly volume to explore this seminal recording at length, bringing together contributions by some of the most eminent scholars of rock music writing today. It marks a reconsideration of this iconic but under-appreciated recording and reaffirms the White Album's significance in the Beatles' career and in rock history. This volume treats the White Album as a whole, with essays scrutinizing it from a wide range of perspectives. These essays place the album within the social and political context of a turbulent historical moment; locate it within the Beatles' lives and careers, taking into consideration the complex personal forces at play during the recording sessions; investigate the musical as well as pharmaceutical influences on the record; reveal how it reflects new developments in the Beatles' songwriting and arranging; revisit the question of its alleged disunity; and finally, track its legacy and the breadth of its influence on later rock, pop, and hip-hop artists. The Beatles through a Glass Onion features the scholarship of Adam Bradley, Vincent Benitez, Lori Burns, John Covach, Walter Everett, Michael Frontani, Steve Hamelman, Ian Inglis, John Kimsey, Mark Osteen, Russell Reising, Stephen Valdez, Anthony D. Villa, Kenneth Womack, and Alyssa Woods. John Covach's Afterword summarizes the White Album's lasting impact and value. As the first essay collection focusing on the White Album, The Beatles through a Glass Onion represents a landmark work of rock music scholarship. It will prove to be an essential and enduring contribution to the field.  aDescription based on information from publisher.20aBeatles.tBeatles.20aBeatles.20aBeatlesxInfluence. 0aRock groupszEnglandxCriticism and interpretation. 0aRock musicxCriticism and interpretation. 4aElectronic books.1 aOsteen, Mark,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aTracking pop.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.945078302401nam a2200373Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204024003000233035002200263050001100285245016400296246007100460264006400531300003500595336002600630337002600656338003600682490002900718504005100747520091900798588005301717650002501770650002301795655002201818710006501840830003001905856009201935on107627471320181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126s2019    miuad   ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124671qelectronic book  a0472124676qelectronic book  z9780472131211qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.97960882doi  a(OCoLC)1076274713 4aJF100100aParty mandates and democracy :bmaking, breaking, and keeping election pledges in twelve countries /cElin Naurin, Terry J.

Promises raise hopes that positive policy changes are possible, but people are generally skeptical of these promises. Party Mandates and Democracy reveals the extent to and conditions under which governments fulfill party promises during election campaigns. Contrary to conventional wisdom a majority of pledges-sometimes a large majority-are fulfilled in most countries, most of the time. The fulfillment of parties' election pledges is an essential part of the democratic process. This book is the first major, genuinely comparative study of promises across a broad range of countries and elections, including the United States, Canada, nine Western European countries, and Bulgaria. The book thus adds to the body of literature on the variety of outcomes stemming from alternative democratic institutions.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPolitical campaigns. 0aCampaign promises. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aNew comparative politics.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.979608802850nam a2200421Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204024003100233035002200264043001200286050001200298100002900310245010200339264005400441300005700495336002600552337002600578338003600604490002900640504005100669520128100720588005302001650002702054650003902081650003602120651003002156651003202186655002202218710006502240830003002305856009302335on107627471420181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124831qelectronic book  a0472124838qelectronic book  z9780472131259qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.100584462doi  a(OCoLC)1076274714  aa-ii--- 4aHN683.51 aLee, Alexander,eauthor.10aDevelopment in multiple dimensions :bsocial power and regional policy in India /cAlexander Lee. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (xii, 272 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew comparative politics  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aWhy do some states provide infrastructure and social services to their citizens, and others do not? In Development in Multiple Dimensions, Alexander Lee examines the origins of success and failure in the public services of developing countries. Comparing states within India, this study examines how elites either control, or are shut out of, policy decisions and how the interests of these elites influence public policy. He shows that social inequalities are not single but multiple, creating groups of competing elites with divergent policy interests. Since the power of these elites varies, states do not necessarily focus on the same priorities: some focus on infrastructure, others on social services, and still others on both or neither. The author develops his ideas through quantitative comparisons and case studies focusing on four northern Indian states: Gujarat, West Bengal, Bihar, and Himachal Pradesh, each of which represents different types of political economy and has a different set of powerful caste groups. The evidence indicates that regional variation in India is a consequence of social differences, and the impact of these differences on carefully considered distributional strategies, rather than differences in ideology, geography, or institutions.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aSocial servicezIndia. 0aInfrastructure (Economics)zIndia. 0aElite (Social sciences)zIndia. 0aIndiaxSocial conditions. 0aIndiaxEconomic conditions. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aNew comparative politics.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1005844602317nam a2200397Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003700137020003400174020003100208020003100239024003100270035002200301050000800323100002700331245009900358250002000457264006400477300005100541336002600592337002600618338003600644504005600680520084500736588005301581650003401634650004401668650003501712655002201747700004301769710006501812856004201877on107627471620181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126s2019    miua    ob    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124787q(electronic book)  a0472124781q(electronic book)  z9780472131235q(hardcover)  z9780472037353q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.100722082doi  a(OCoLC)1076274716 4aH611 aBeach, Derek,eauthor.10aProcess-tracing methods :bfoundations and guidelines /cDerek Beach and Rasmus Brun Pedersen.  aSecond Edition. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (281 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 258-279)3 aProcess-tracing in social science is a method for studying causal mechanisms that link causes with outcomes, enabling the researcher to make strong inferences about how a cause (or set of causes) contributes to producing an outcome. In this extensively revised and updated edition, Derek Beach and Rasmus Brun Pedersen introduce a refined definition of process-tracing, differentiating it into three distinct variants and explaining the applications and limitations of each. The authors develop the underlying logic of process-tracing, including how one should understand causal mechanisms and how Bayesian logic enables strong within-case inferences. They provide instructions for identifying the variant of process-tracing most appropriate for the research question at hand, and a set of guidelines for each stage of the research process.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aSocial sciencesxMethodology. 0aSocial sciencesxResearchxMethodology. 0aSocial sciencesvCase studies. 4aElectronic books.1 aPedersen, Rasmus Brun,d1978-eauthor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1007220802733nam a2200421Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003700137020003400174020003100208024003100239035002200270043001200292050001500304100003600319245018800355264006400543300005200607336002600659337002600685338003600711490003600747504005600783520103100839588005301870650005301923650006401976650004902040655002202089700003002111700003302141710006502174830003002239856004202269on107627456220181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126s2019    miua    ob    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124640q(electronic book)  a0472124641q(electronic book)  z9780472131181q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.100331012doi  a(OCoLC)1076274562  ae------ 4aHD3616.E831 aDuÃàr, Andreas,d1976-eauthor.14aThe political influence of business in the European Union /cAndres DuÃàr, University of Salzburg ; David Marshall, University of Reading ; Patrick Bernhagen, University of Stuttgart. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (266 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aNew comparative politics series  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 217-254)3 aMany citizens, politicians, and political activists voice concern about the political influence of business in the European Union (EU). But do business interests really pull the strings in Brussels? Contrary to expectations, this book shows that business is no more influential than other interests in shaping contemporary EU policies. Andreas DuIÃÄ‚Å∏r, David Marshall, and Patrick Bernhagen present an original argument that stresses the role of public actors in facilitating or impeding interest groups' lobbying success. Novel data on a large number of legislative proposals on the EU's agenda, and three case studies present strong support for this argument. In this process, The Political Influence of Business in the European Union offers new insights into how lobbying success depends on the demand and supply of information as well as new ideas on how to measure lobbying success. The book advances a fresh perspective on the question of business power and on why business interests often lose in the policy struggle.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aBusiness and politicszEuropean Union countries. 0aCorporationsxPolitical activityzEuropean Union countries. 0aIndustrial policyzEuropean Union countries. 4aElectronic books.1 aMarshall, David,eauthor.1 aBernhagen, Patrick,eauthor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aNew comparative politics.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1003310103183nam a2200361Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003700137020003400174020003100208024003100239035002200270050001500292100002900307245007300336264006400409300003400473336002600507337002600533338003600559504005100595520096700646520091601613588005302529600005002582650006002632655002202692710006502714856004202779on107627456320181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126s2019    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124794q(electronic book)  a047212479Xq(electronic book)  z9780472131228q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.100231872doi  a(OCoLC)1076274563 4aML429.S4151 aMcClary, Susan,eauthor.14aThe passions of Peter Sellars :bstaging the music /cSusan McClary. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (207 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aRecognized as one of the most innovative and influential directors of our time, Peter Sellars has produced acclaimed-and often controversial-versions of many beloved operas and oratorios. He has also collaborated with several composers, including John C. Adams and Kaija Saariaho, to create challenging new operas. The Passions of Peter Sellars follows the development of his style, beginning with his interpretations of the Mozart-Da Ponte operas, proceeding to works for which he assembled the libretti and even the music, and concluding with his celebrated stagings of Bach's passions with the Berlin Philharmonic. Many directors leave the musical aspects of opera entirely to the singers and conductor. Sellars, however, immerses himself in the score, and has created a distinctive visual vocabulary to embody musical gesture on stage, drawing on the energies of the music as he shapes characters, ensemble interaction, and large-scale dramatic trajectories.3 aAs a leading scholar of gender and music, and the history of opera, Susan McClary is ideally positioned to illuminate Sellars's goal to address both the social tensions embodied in these operas as well as the spiritual dimensions of operatic performance. McClary considers Sellars's productions of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, and CosiIÃÄ‚Å∞ fan tutte; Handel's‚Ñó Theodora; Messiaen's Saint FrancIÃÄ πois d'Assise; John C. Adams's Nixon in China, The Death of Klinghoffer, El NinIÃÄ¬≥o, and Doctor Atomic; Kaija Saariaho's L'amour de loin, La Passion de Simone, and Only the Sound Remains; Purcell's The Indian Queen; and Bach's passions of Saint Matthew and Saint John. Approaching Sellars's theatrical strategies from a musicological perspective, McClary blends insights from theater, film, and literary scholarship to explore the work of one of the most brilliant living interpreters of opera.  aDescription based on information from publisher.10aSellars, PeterxCriticism and interpretation. 0aOperaxProduction and directionxHistoryy20th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1002318702730nam a2200409Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003700137020001500174020003000189024003100219035002200250043001200272050001600284245006000300264006400360300002300424336002600447337002600473338003600499490005500535504005100590520122900641588005701870650003801927650002101965650003101986650003702017655002202054700003302076710006202109830005602171856009302227on107627471720181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126s2019    miu     ob    001 0 eng    aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124602q(electronic book)  a0472124609  z9780472131143 (hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.100282712doi  a(OCoLC)1076274717  aa-ja--- 4aHQ1236.5.J300aBeyond the gender gap in Japan /cedited by Gill Steel. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aCenter for Japanese Studies monograph series ;v85  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aWhy do Japanese women enjoy a high sense of well-being in a context of high inequality? Beyond the Gender Gap in Japan brings together researchers from across the social sciences to investigate this question. The authors analyze women's values and the lived experiences at home, in the family, at work, in their leisure time, as volunteers, and in politics and policy-making. Their research shows that the state and firms have blurred "the public" and "the private" in postwar Japan, constraining individuals' lives, and reveals the uneven pace of change in women's representation in politics. Yet, despite these constraints, the increasing diversification in how people live and how they manage their lives demonstrates that some people are crafting a variety of individual solutions to structural problems. Covering a significant breadth of material, the book presents comprehensive findings that use a variety of research methods-public opinion surveys, in-depth interviews, a life history, and participant observation-and, in doing so, look beyond Japan's perennially low rankings in gender equality indices to demonstrate the diversity underneath, questioning some of the stereotypical assumptions about women in Japan.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aWomenxPolitical activityzJapan. 0aFeminismzJapan. 0aSex discriminationzJapan. 0aWomenzJapanxSocial conditions. 4aElectronic books.1 aSteel, Gill,d1965-eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher. 0aCenter for Japanese Studies monograph series ;v85.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1002827103497nam a2200445Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020003100204020002900235024002300264035002200287050001500309100002700324245008800351246004500439264006500484264001000549300002300559336002600582337002600608338003600634490004500670504004100715520165900756542015002415588005302565650003302618650001902651650003902670655002202709710006502731770012602796830003602922856009302958on107627471820181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472125005qelectronic book  a0472125001qelectronic book  z9780472901043qopen access  z9780472131273qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.2doi  a(OCoLC)1076274718 4aP301.5.D371 aBrock, Kevin,eauthor.10aRhetorical code studies :bdiscovering arguments in and around code /cKevin Brock.30aDiscovering arguments in and around code 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aSweetland digital rhetoric collaborative  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 a"Software developers work rhetorically to make meaning through the code they write. In some ways, writing code is like any other form of communication; in others, it proves to be new, exciting, and unique. In Rhetorical Code Studies, Kevin Brock explores how software code serves as meaningful communication through which software developers construct arguments that are made up of logical procedures and express both implicit and explicit claims as to how a given program operates.‚Ñó  Building on current scholarly work in digital rhetoric, software studies, and technical communication, Brock connects and continues ongoing conversations among rhetoricians, technical communicators, software studies scholars, and programming practitioners to demonstrate how software code and its surrounding discourse are highly rhetorical forms of communication. He considers examples ranging from large, well-known projects like Mozilla Firefox to small-scale programs like the "FizzBuzz" test common in many‚Ñó  programming job interviews. Undertaking specific examinations of code texts as well as the contexts surrounding their composition, Brock illuminates the variety and depth of rhetorical activity taking place in and around code, from individual differences in style to changes in large-scale organizational and community norms.

Elizabeth B. Bearden contends that monstrosity, as a precursor to modern concepts of disability, has much to teach about our tendency to inscribe disability with meaning. Understanding how early modern writers approached disability not only provides more accurate genealogies of disability, but also helps nuance current aesthetic and theoretical disability formulations. The book analyzes the cultural valences of early modern disability across a broad national and chronological span, attending to the specific bodily, spatial, and aesthetic systems that contributed to early modern literary representations of disability. The cross section of texts (including conduct books and treatises, travel writing and wonder books) is comparative, putting canonical European authors such as Castiglione into dialogue with transatlantic and Anglo-Ottoman literary exchange.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxSocial aspectsyEarly modern, 1500-1700. 0aHuman bodyxSocial aspectsyEarly modern, 1500-1700. 0aPeople with disabilities in literature. 0aPeople with disabilities in art. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aCorporealities.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1001435502279nam a2200397Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003700137020003400174020003100208020002800239024003000267035002200297043001200319050001200331100003000343245012900373246007200502264006500574264001000639300003900649336002600688337002600714338003600740504004100776520082800817588005301645650003201698650002301730655002201753710006501775856004101840on107627471920181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126t20192019miua    ob    000 u eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124626q(electronic book)  a0472124625q(electronic book)  a9780472131167q(hardcover)  a0472131168q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.99927032doi  a(OCoLC)1076274719  ae------ 4aHN373.51 aCianetti, Licia,eauthor.14aThe quality of divided democracies :bMinority inclusion, exclusion, and representation in the New Europe /cLicia Cianetti.30aMinority Inclusion, Exclusion, and Representation in the New Europe 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aThe Quality of Divided Democracies contemplates how democracy works, or fails to work, in ethno-culturally divided societies. It advances a new theoretical approach to assessing the quality of democracy in divided societies, and puts it into practice with the focused comparison of two divided democracies-Estonia and Latvia. The book uses rich comparative data to tackle the vital questions of what determines a democracy's level of inclusiveness and the ways in which minorities can gain access to the policy-making process. It uncovers a "voice-polarization dilemma" for minorities' inclusion in the democratic process, which has implications for academic debates on minority representation and ethnic politics, as well as practical implications for international and national institutions' promotion of minority rights.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aSocial integrationzEurope. 0aDemocracyzEurope. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.999270303945nam a2200481Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204020002900233024003000262035002200292041001300314050001900327100002800346240003200374245018800406264006500594264001000659300003500669336002600704337002600730338003600756490002500792520201100817588005302828650004702881650007002928650005602998655002203054700003303076700003703109700003803146700003203184700003303216710006503249830005703314856009203371on107627472320181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126t20192019miu     o     000 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124381qelectronic book  a0472124382qelectronic book  z9780472074068qhardcover  z9780472054060qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.97091522doi  a(OCoLC)10762747231 aenghfre 4aPQ3989.2.N54460 aNimrod,d1959-eauthor.10aWorkskSelections.lEnglish10aNimrod :bselected works /cFrieda Ekotto, editor ; prose translated by Dawn Cornelio ; poetry translated by Catherine du Toit, Patrick Williamson, and Emily Goedde and Sylvie Kandel. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (248 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aAfrican perspectives3 aThe Chadian writer Nimrod-philosopher, poet, novelist, and essayist-is one of the most dynamic and vital voices in contemporary African literature and thought. Yet little of Nimrod's writing has been translated into English until now. Introductory material by Frieda Ekotto provides context for Nimrod's work and demonstrates the urgency of making it available beyond Francophone Africa to a broader global audience. At the heart of this volume are Nimrod's essays on LeIÃÄ‚Ñó‚Ñóƒêopold SeIÃÄ‚Ñó‚Ñóƒêdar Senghor, a key figure in the literary and aesthetic NeIÃÄ‚Ñó‚Ñóƒêgritude movement of the 1930s and president of Senegal from 1945 through 1980. Widely dismissed in recent decades as problematically essentialist, Senghorian Negritude articulated notions of "blackness" as a way of transcending deep divisions across a Black Diaspora under French colonial rule. Nimrod offers a nuanced reading of Senghor, drawing out the full complexities of Senghor's philosophy and reevaluating how race and colonialism function in a French-speaking space. Also included in this volume are Nimrod's essays on literature from the 2008 collection, The New French Matter (La nouvelle chose francIÃÄ&#xca;‚Ñóƒêaise). Representing his prose fiction is his 2010 work, Rivers' Gold (L'or des rivieIÃÄÃ&#x81;&#x81;&#xca;&#xbb;res). Also featured are some of Nimrod's best-loved poems, in both English translation and the original French. The works selected and translated for this volume showcase Nimrod's versatility, his intellectual liveliness, and his exploration of questions of aesthetics in African literature, philosophy, and linguistics. Nimrod: Selected Writings marks a significant contribution toward engaging a broader audience with one of the vital voices of our time. This book will be essential reading for Anglophone students and scholars of African philosophy, literature, poetry, and critical theory, and will offer a welcome introduction to Nimrod for general readers of contemporary international writing.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aChadian literature (French)y20th century. 0aChadian literature (French)y20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aAfrican literature (French)xHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.1 aCornelio, Dawn,etranslator.1 aDu Toit, Catherine,etranslator.1 aWilliamson, Patrick,etranslator.1 aGoedde, Emily,etranslator.1 aKandel, Sylvie,etranslator.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aAfrican perspectives (University of Michigan.

When political scientists began to examine whether the state ballot initiative process had spillover consequences, they found the initiative process had a positive impact on civic engagement. Recent scholarship casts doubt on these conclusions, determining the ballot initiative process in fact did not make people believe they could influence the political process, trust the government, or be more knowledgeable about politics. However, in some circumstances, it got them to show up at the polls, and increased interest groups' participation in the political arena. In this book, Dyck and Lascher develop and test a theory that can explain evidence that the ballot initiative process fails to provide the civic benefits commonly claimed for it, and evidence that it increases political participation. This theory argues that the basic function of direct democracy is to create more conflict in society.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aDirect democracyzUnited States. 0aReferendumzUnited States. 4aElectronic books.1 aLascher, Edward L.,eauthor.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.1 iSupplement (work):aDyck, Joshua J.,tInitiatives without engagement.h1 online resource (1 appendix)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.999302403197nam a22003733i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702000290015602400310018504000270021605000130024324501160025626400640037230000520043633600260048833700260051433800360054049000510057650400510062752016590067858800530233765100390239065100390242965100440246865100440251265500220255670000360257871000640261483000520267885600930273020181031155518.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181031s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472125159qelectronic book  z9780472074129qhardcover  z9780472054121qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.100279002doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aDS922.2700aRevisiting Minjung :bnew perspectives on the cultural history of 1980s South Korea /cedited by Sunyoung Park. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (285 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aComparative perspectives on contemporary Korea  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aAn epoch-marking alliance of laborers, students, dissident intellectuals, and ordinary citizens was at the heart of South Korea's transformation from a dictatorship into a vibrant democracy during the 1980s. Collectively known as the minjung ("the people"), these agents of Korean democratization historically carved out an expanded role for civil society in the country's politics. In Revisiting Minjung, some of the foremost experts in 1980s Korean history, literature, film, art, and music provide new insights into one of the most crucial decades in South Korean history. Drawing from the theoretical perspectives of transnationalism, post-Marxist studies, intersectional feminism, popular culture studies, and more, the volume demonstrates how an era that is often associated with radical politics was, in effect, the catalyst for the subsequent flourishing of democratic and liberal values in South Korea. Revisiting Minjung brings new themes, new subjectivities, and new theoretical perspectives to the study of the rich ecosystem of 1980s Korean culture. Treated here is a wide array of topics, including the origins of minjung ideology, its critique by the right wing, minjung art and music, workers' literary culture, women writers and the resurgence of feminism, erotic cinema, science fiction, transnational political travels, and the representations of race and queerness in 1980s popular culture. The book thus details the origins and development of some of the movements that shape cultural life in South Korea today, and it does so through analyses that engage some of the most pressing debates in current scholarship in Korea and abroad.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aKorea (South)xHistoryy1960-1988. 0aKorea (South)xHistoryy1988-2002. 0aKorea (South)xCivilizationy1960-1988. 0aKorea (South)xCivilizationy1988-2002. 4aElectronic books.1 aPark, Sunyoung,d1971-eeditor.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aComparative perspectives on contemporary Korea.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1002790002256nam a22003853i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702000290015602400300018504000270021505000110024224501370025326400640039030000520045433600260050633700260053233800360055849000450059450400510063952007200069058800530141065000490146365000240151265000290153665500220156570000400158770000280162770000390165571000640169483000200175885600920177820181031161357.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181031s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472125098qelectronic book  z9780472074112qhardcover  z9780472054114qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.93651292doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aHV156804aThe matter of disability :bmateriality, biopolitics, crip effect /cDavid T.

The book's contributors offer new theorizations of human and nonhuman embodiments and their complex evolutions in our global present, in essays that explore how disability might be imagined as participant in the "complex elaboration of difference," rather than something gone awry in an otherwise stable process. This alternative approach to materiality sheds new light on the capacities that exist within the depictions of disability that the book examines, including Spider-Man, Of Mice and Men, and Bloodchild.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxSocial conditions. 0aDisability studies. 0aSociology of disability. 4aElectronic books.1 aMitchell, David T.,d1962-eeditor.1 aAntebi, Susan,eeditor.1 aSnyder, Sharon L.,d1963-eeditor.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aCorporealities.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.936512903288nam a22003733i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400300015604000270018605000130021324500950022626400640032130000520038533600260043733700260046333800360048949000240052550400510054952018650060058800530246561000270251861000130254561000240255865000560258265000460263865500220268470000270270671000640273383000250279785600920282220181031163221.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181031s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124848qelectronic book  z9780472074082qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.94507832doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aML421.B404aThe Beatles through a glass onion :breconsidering the White Album /cMark Osteen, editor. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (298 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aTracking pop series  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aThe Beatles, the 1968 double LP more commonly known as the White Album, has always been viewed as an oddity in the group's oeuvre. Many have found it to be inconsistent, sprawling, and self-indulgent. The Beatles through a Glass Onion: Reconsidering the White Album is the first-ever scholarly volume to explore this seminal recording at length, bringing together contributions by some of the most eminent scholars of rock music writing today. It marks a reconsideration of this iconic but under-appreciated recording and reaffirms the White Album's significance in the Beatles' career and in rock history. This volume treats the White Album as a whole, with essays scrutinizing it from a wide range of perspectives. These essays place the album within the social and political context of a turbulent historical moment; locate it within the Beatles' lives and careers, taking into consideration the complex personal forces at play during the recording sessions; investigate the musical as well as pharmaceutical influences on the record; reveal how it reflects new developments in the Beatles' songwriting and arranging; revisit the question of its alleged disunity; and finally, track its legacy and the breadth of its influence on later rock, pop, and hip-hop artists. The Beatles through a Glass Onion features the scholarship of Adam Bradley, Vincent Benitez, Lori Burns, John Covach, Walter Everett, Michael Frontani, Steve Hamelman, Ian Inglis, John Kimsey, Mark Osteen, Russell Reising, Stephen Valdez, Anthony D. Villa, Kenneth Womack, and Alyssa Woods. John Covach's Afterword summarizes the White Album's lasting impact and value. As the first essay collection focusing on the White Album, The Beatles through a Glass Onion represents a landmark work of rock music scholarship. It will prove to be an essential and enduring contribution to the field.  aDescription based on information from publisher.20aBeatles.tWhite album.20aBeatles.20aBeatlesxInfluence. 0aRock groupszEnglandxCriticism and interpretation. 0aRock musicxCriticism and interpretation. 4aElectronic books.1 aOsteen, Mark,eeditor.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aTracking pop series.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.945078302911nam a22003493i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400310015604000270018705000100021410000320022424500920025626400540034830000560040233600260045833700260048433800360051050400510054652015500059758800530214765000430220065000410224365000300228465000300231465000380234465500220238271000640240485600930246820181003130635.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181003s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124596qelectronic book  z9780472131136qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.100209942doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aJK5221 aJewitt, Caitlin E.eauthor.14aThe primary rules :bparties, voters, and presidential nominations /cCaitin E.

Yet the parties wield more influence than voters in determining who prevails at the National Conventions. Although the reforms of the late 1960s and 1970s gave rank-and-file party members a clear voice in the selection of presidential candidates, the parties retain influence through their ability to set the electoral rules. Despite this capability, party elites do not always fully understand the consequences of the rules and therefore often promote a system that undermines their goals. The Primary Rules illuminates the balance of power that the parties, states, and voters assert on the process. By utilizing an original, comprehensive data set that details the electoral rules that each party employed in each state during every nomination from 1976 to 2016, Caitlin E. Jewitt uncovers the effects of the rules on the competitiveness of the nomination, the number of voters who participate, and the nomination outcomes. This reveals how the parties exert influence over their members and limit the impact of voters. The Primary Rules highlights the role of the parties in the invisible primary stage, as it investigates the parties' influence once the nominations begin. The Primary Rules provides readers with a clearer sense of what the rules are, how they have changed, their consequences, and practical guidance on how to modify the rules of the nomination system to achieve desired outcomes in future elections.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPresidentszUnited StatesxNomination. 0aPresidentszUnited StatesxElection. 0aPrimarieszUnited States. 0aElectionszUnited States. 0aPolitical partieszUnited States. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1002099402292nam a22003373i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400300015604000270018605000110021324501640022424600710038826400640045930000350052333600260055833700260058433800360061049000290064650400510067552009190072658800530164565000250169865000230172365500220174671000640176883000300183285600920186220181018072944.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181017s2019    miuad   ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124671qelectronic book  z9780472131211qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.97960882doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aJF100100aParty mandates and democracy :bmaking, breaking, and keeping election pledges in twelve countries /cElin Naurin, Terry J.

Promises raise hopes that positive policy changes are possible, but people are generally skeptical of these promises. Party Mandates and Democracy reveals the extent to and conditions under which governments fulfill party promises during election campaigns. Contrary to conventional wisdom a majority of pledges-sometimes a large majority-are fulfilled in most countries, most of the time. The fulfillment of parties' election pledges is an essential part of the democratic process. This book is the first major, genuinely comparative study of promises across a broad range of countries and elections, including the United States, Canada, nine Western European countries, and Bulgaria. The book thus adds to the body of literature on the variety of outcomes stemming from alternative democratic institutions.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPolitical campaigns. 0aCampaign promises. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aNew comparative politics.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.979608802717nam a22003733i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400310015604000270018705000120021410000290022624501020025526400540035730000570041133600260046833700260049433800360052049000290055650400510058552012810063658800530191765000270197065000390199765000360203665100300207265100320210265500220213471000640215683000300222085600930225020181003145316.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181003s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124831qelectronic book  z9780472131259qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.100584462doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aHN683.51 aLee, Alexander,eauthor.10aDevelopment in multiple dimensions :bsocial power and regional policy in India /cAlexander Lee. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (xii, 272 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew comparative politics  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aWhy do some states provide infrastructure and social services to their citizens, and others do not? In Development in Multiple Dimensions, Alexander Lee examines the origins of success and failure in the public services of developing countries. Comparing states within India, this study examines how elites either control, or are shut out of, policy decisions and how the interests of these elites influence public policy. He shows that social inequalities are not single but multiple, creating groups of competing elites with divergent policy interests. Since the power of these elites varies, states do not necessarily focus on the same priorities: some focus on infrastructure, others on social services, and still others on both or neither. The author develops his ideas through quantitative comparisons and case studies focusing on four northern Indian states: Gujarat, West Bengal, Bihar, and Himachal Pradesh, each of which represents different types of political economy and has a different set of powerful caste groups. The evidence indicates that regional variation in India is a consequence of social differences, and the impact of these differences on carefully considered distributional strategies, rather than differences in ideology, geography, or institutions.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aSocial servicezIndia. 0aInfrastructure (Economics)zIndia. 0aElite (Social sciences)zIndia. 0aIndiaxSocial conditions. 0aIndiaxEconomic conditions. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aNew comparative politics.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1005844602317nam a22003253i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702000290015602400310018504000270021605000130024310000330025624501040028926400660039330000510045933600260051033700260053633800360056250400510059852010370064958800530168665100360173965100370177565500220181271000640183485600930189820181002144807.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181002s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472125036qelectronic book  z9780472074105qhardcover  z9780472054107qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.100065432doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aDS849.K61 aKimura, Kan,d1966-eauthor.14aThe burden of the past :bproblems of historical perception in Japan-Korea relations /cKan Kimura. 1a[Ann Arbor, Michigan] :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (221 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aThe Burden of the Past reexamines the dispute over historical perception between Japan and South Korea, going beyond the descriptive emphasis of previous studies to clearly identify the many independent variables that have affected the situation. From the history textbook debates, to the Occupation-period exploitation of "comfort women," to the Dokdo/Takeshima territory dispute and Yasukuni Shrine visits, Professor Kimura traces the rise and fall of popular, political, and international concerns underlying these complex and highly-fraught issues. Utilizing Japanese and South Korean newspaper databases to review discussion of the two countries' disputed historical perceptions from the end of World War II to the present, The Burden of the Past provides readers with the historical framework and the major players involved, offering much-needed clarity on such polarizing issues. By seeing behind the public discourse and political rhetoric, this book offers a firmer footing for a discussion and the steps toward resolution.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aJapanxRelationszKorea (South) 0aKorea (South)xRelationszJapan. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1000654302206nam a22003613i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000310012902000310016002400310019104000270022205000080024910000270025724500990028425000200038326400640040330000510046733600260051833700260054433800360057050400560060652008450066258800530150765000340156065000440159465000350163865500220167370000430169571000640173885600420180220180914133845.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180912s2019    miua    ob    000 0 eng d  a9780472124787q(electronic book)  z9780472131235q(hardcover)  z9780472037353q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.100722082doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aH611 aBeach, Derek,eauthor.10aProcess-tracing methods :bfoundations and guidelines /cDerek Beach and Rasmus Brun Pedersen.  aSecond Edition. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (281 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 258-279)3 aProcess-tracing in social science is a method for studying causal mechanisms that link causes with outcomes, enabling the researcher to make strong inferences about how a cause (or set of causes) contributes to producing an outcome.

The authors develop the underlying logic of process-tracing, including how one should understand causal mechanisms and how Bayesian logic enables strong within-case inferences.

But do business interests really pull the strings in Brussels? Contrary to expectations, this book shows that business is no more influential than other interests in shaping contemporary EU policies. Andreas DuÃàr, David Marshall, and Patrick Bernhagen present an original argument that stresses the role of public actors in facilitating or impeding interest groups' lobbying success. Novel data on a large number of legislative proposals on the EU's agenda, and three case studies present strong support for this argument. In this process, The Political Influence of Business in the European Union offers new insights into how lobbying success depends on the demand and supply of information as well as new ideas on how to measure lobbying success. The book advances a fresh perspective on the question of business power and on why business interests often lose in the policy struggle.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aBusiness and politicszEuropean Union countries. 0aCorporationsxPolitical activityzEuropean Union countries. 0aIndustrial policyzEuropean Union countries. 4aElectronic books.1 aMarshall, David,eauthor.1 aBernhagen, Patrick,eauthor.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aNew comparative politics.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1003310103060nam a22003253i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000310012902400310016004000270019105000150021810000290023324500730026226400640033530000340039933600260043333700260045933800360048550400510052152009670057252009040153958800530244360000500249665000600254665500220260671000640262885600420269220180914134421.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180912s2019    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124794q(electronic book)  z9780472131228q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.100231872doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aML429.S4151 aMcClary, Susan,eauthor.14aThe passions of Peter Sellars :bstaging the music /cSusan McClary. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (207 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aRecognized as one of the most innovative and influential directors of our time, Peter Sellars has produced acclaimed-and often controversial-versions of many beloved operas and oratorios. He has also collaborated with several composers, including John C. Adams and Kaija Saariaho, to create challenging new operas. The Passions of Peter Sellars follows the development of his style, beginning with his interpretations of the Mozart-Da Ponte operas, proceeding to works for which he assembled the libretti and even the music, and concluding with his celebrated stagings of Bach's passions with the Berlin Philharmonic. Many directors leave the musical aspects of opera entirely to the singers and conductor. Sellars, however, immerses himself in the score, and has created a distinctive visual vocabulary to embody musical gesture on stage, drawing on the energies of the music as he shapes characters, ensemble interaction, and large-scale dramatic trajectories.3 aAs a leading scholar of gender and music, and the history of opera, Susan McClary is ideally positioned to illuminate Sellars's goal to address both the social tensions embodied in these operas as well as the spiritual dimensions of operatic performance. McClary considers Sellars's productions of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, and CosiÃÄ fan tutte; Handel's¬†Theodora; Messiaen's Saint FrancÃßois d'Assise; John C. Adams's Nixon in China, The Death of Klinghoffer, El NinÃÉo, and Doctor Atomic; Kaija Saariaho's L'amour de loin, La Passion de Simone, and Only the Sound Remains; Purcell's The Indian Queen; and Bach's passions of Saint Matthew and Saint John. Approaching Sellars's theatrical strategies from a musicological perspective, McClary blends insights from theater, film, and literary scholarship to explore the work of one of the most brilliant living interpreters of opera.  aDescription based on information from publisher.10aSellars, PeterxCriticism and interpretation. 0aOperaxProduction and directionxHistoryy20th century. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1002318702665cam  2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000150012902000300014402400310017404000270020504300120023205000160024424500600026026400640032030000230038433600260040733700260043333800360045949000550049550400510055052012290060158800570183065000380188765000210192565000310194665000370197765500220201470000330203671000610206983000560213085600930218620180917092435.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180804s2019    miu     ob    001 0 eng    a9780472124602q(electronic book)  a0472124609  z9780472131143 (hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.100282712doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  aa-ja--- 4aHQ1236.5.J300aBeyond the gender gap in Japan /cedited by Gill Steel. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aCenter for Japanese Studies monograph series ;v85  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aWhy do Japanese women enjoy a high sense of well-being in a context of high inequality? Beyond the Gender Gap in Japan brings together researchers from across the social sciences to investigate this question. The authors analyze women's values and the lived experiences at home, in the family, at work, in their leisure time, as volunteers, and in politics and policy-making. Their research shows that the state and firms have blurred "the public" and "the private" in postwar Japan, constraining individuals' lives, and reveals the uneven pace of change in women's representation in politics. Yet, despite these constraints, the increasing diversification in how people live and how they manage their lives demonstrates that some people are crafting a variety of individual solutions to structural problems. Covering a significant breadth of material, the book presents comprehensive findings that use a variety of research methods-public opinion surveys, in-depth interviews, a life history, and participant observation-and, in doing so, look beyond Japan's perennially low rankings in gender equality indices to demonstrate the diversity underneath, questioning some of the stereotypical assumptions about women in Japan.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aWomenxPolitical activityzJapan. 0aFeminismzJapan. 0aSex discriminationzJapan. 0aWomenzJapanxSocial conditions. 4aElectronic books.1 aSteel, Gill,d1965-eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aCenter for Japanese Studies monograph series ;v85.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1002827103384nam a22004093i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000310012702000290015802400230018704000270021005000150023710000270025224500880027924600450036726400650041226400100047730000230048733600260051033700260053633800360056249000450059850400410064352016550068454201500233958800530248965000330254265000190257565000390259465500220263371000640265577001260271983000360284585600930288120180924154802.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180924t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472125005qelectronic book  z9780472901043qopen access  z9780472131273qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.2doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aP301.5.D371 aBrock, Kevin,eauthor.10aRhetorical code studies :bdiscovering arguments in and around code /cKevin Brock.30aDiscovering arguments in and around code 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aSweetland digital rhetoric collaborative  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 a"Software developers work rhetorically to make meaning through the code they write. In some ways, writing code is like any other form of communication; in others, it proves to be new, exciting, and unique. In Rhetorical Code Studies, Kevin Brock explores how software code serves as meaningful communication through which software developers construct arguments that are made up of logical procedures and express both implicit and explicit claims as to how a given program operates.¬† Building on current scholarly work in digital rhetoric, software studies, and technical communication, Brock connects and continues ongoing conversations among rhetoricians, technical communicators, software studies scholars, and programming practitioners to demonstrate how software code and its surrounding discourse are highly rhetorical forms of communication. He considers examples ranging from large, well-known projects like Mozilla Firefox to small-scale programs like the "FizzBuzz" test common in many¬† programming job interviews. Undertaking specific examinations of code texts as well as the contexts surrounding their composition, Brock illuminates the variety and depth of rhetorical activity taking place in and around code, from individual differences in style to changes in large-scale organizational and community norms. Rhetorical Code Studies holds significant implications for digital communication, multimodal composition, and the cultural analysis of software and its creation. It will interest academics and students of writing, rhetoric, and software engineering as well as technical communicators and developers of all types of software."1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International licenseuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aRhetoricxComputer programs. 0aCoding theory. 0aComputer softwarexSocial aspects. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.08iSupplement (work):aBrock, Kevin.tRhetorical code studies : discovering arguments in and around code.h1 online resource 0aDigital rhetoric collaborative.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1001929103074nam a22003973i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400310015604000270018705000110021410000360022524501190026124600760038026400650045626400100052130000400053133600260057133700260059733800360062349000450065950400510070450504800075552009800123558800530221565000710226865000570233965000440239665000370244065500220247771000640249983000200256385600930258320180912190138.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180912t20192019miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124589qelectronic book  z9780472131129qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.100143552doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aHV15521 aBearden, Elizabeth B.,eauthor.10aMonstrous kinds :bbody, space, and narrative in Renaissance representations of disability/cElizabeth B.

Elizabeth B. Bearden contends that monstrosity, as a precursor to modern concepts of disability, has much to teach about our tendency to inscribe disability with meaning. Understanding how early modern writers approached disability not only provides more accurate genealogies of disability, but also helps nuance current aesthetic and theoretical disability formulations. The book analyzes the cultural valences of early modern disability across a broad national and chronological span, attending to the specific bodily, spatial, and aesthetic systems that contributed to early modern literary representations of disability. The cross section of texts (including conduct books and treatises, travel writing and wonder books) is comparative, putting canonical European authors such as Castiglione into dialogue with transatlantic and Anglo-Ottoman literary exchange.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxSocial aspectsyEarly modern, 1500-1700. 0aHuman bodyxSocial aspectsyEarly modern, 1500-1700. 0aPeople with disabilities in literature. 0aPeople with disabilities in art. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aCorporealities.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1001435502104nam a22003373i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000310012902400300016004000270019005000120021710000300022924501290025924600720038826400650046026400100052530000390053533600260057433700260060033800360062650400410066252008280070358800530153165000320158465000230161665500220163971000640166185600410172520180917102858.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180912t20192019miua    ob    000 | eng d  a9780472124626q(electronic book)  a9780472131167q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.99927032doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aHN373.51 aCianetti, Licia,eauthor.14aThe quality of divided democracies :bMinority inclusion, exclusion, and representation in the New Europe /cLicia Cianetti.30aMinority Inclusion, Exclusion, and Representation in the New Europe 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aThe Quality of Divided Democracies contemplates how democracy works, or fails to work, in ethno-culturally divided societies. It advances a new theoretical approach to assessing the quality of democracy in divided societies, and puts it into practice with the focused comparison of two divided democracies-Estonia and Latvia. The book uses rich comparative data to tackle the vital questions of what determines a democracy's level of inclusiveness and the ways in which minorities can gain access to the policy-making process. It uncovers a "voice-polarization dilemma" for minorities' inclusion in the democratic process, which has implications for academic debates on minority representation and ethnic politics, as well as practical implications for international and national institutions' promotion of minority rights.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aSocial integrationzEurope. 0aDemocracyzEurope. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.999270303413nam a22003973i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400310015604000270018705000220021410000370023624501000027324600460037326400650041926400100048430000230049433600260051733700260054333800360056949000680060550400510067350505980072452012100132258800530253265000480258565000500263365000570268365000390274065500220277971000640280183000570286585600930292220180914150201.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180911t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124619qelectronic book  z9780472131150qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.100112552doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aHG5993b.G73 20191 aGraham, Benjamin A.

In Investing in the Homeland, Benjamin Graham finds that diasporans-migrants and their descendants-play a critical role in linking foreign firms to social networks in developing countries, allowing firms to flourish even in challenging political environments most foreign investors shun. Graham's analysis draws on new data from face-to-face interviews with the managers of over 450 foreign firms operating in two developing countries: Georgia and the Philippines. Diaspora-owned and diaspora-managed firms are better connected than other foreign firms and they use social ties to resolve disputes and influence government policy. At the same time, Graham shows that diaspora-affiliated firms are no more socially responsible than their purely foreign peers-at root, they are profit-seeking enterprises, not development NGOs. Graham identifies implications for policymakers seeking to capture the development potential of diaspora investment and for managers of multinational firms who want to harness diasporans as a source of sustained competitive advantage.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aInvestments, ForeignzDeveloping countries. 0aEmigration and immigrationxEconomic aspects. 0aGlobalizationxSocial aspectszDeveloping countries. 0aBrain drainzDeveloping countries. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aMichigan studies in international political economy.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1001125503065nam a22004093i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000330012902000310016202400300019304000270022305000150025010000250026524501410029024600710043126400650050230000400056733600260060733700260063333800360065949000340069550400510072952012930078053600380207354201320211158800530224365000230229665000210231965000440234065500220238471000640240677001080247083000360257885600410261420180917081315.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180913s2019    miua    ob    001 | ||| d  a9780472124558q(electronic book)  a9780472900879q(open access)  z9780472131112q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.99647862doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aQA76.9.A941 aKee, Kevin,eauthor.10aSeeing the Past with Computers :bExperiments with Augmented Reality and Computer Vision for History /cKevin Kee and Timothy J Compeau.30aExperiments with Augmented Reality and Computer Vision for History 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019]  a1 online resource :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aComp digial humanities series  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aHerbert Blau (1926-2013) was the most influential theater theorist, practitioner, and educator of his generation. He was the leading American interpreter of the works of Samuel Beckett and as a director was instrumental in introducing works of the European avant-garde to American audiences. He was also one of the most far-reaching and thoughtful American theorists of theater and performance, and author of influential books such as The Dubious Spectacle, The Audience, and Take Up the Bodies: Theater at the Vanishing Point.In The Very Thought of Herbert Blau, distinguished artists and scholars offer reflections on what made Blau's contributions so visionary, transformative, and unforgettable, and why his ideas endure in both seminar rooms and studios.

Gontarski, Linda Gregerson, Martin Harries, Bill Irwin, Julia Jarcho, Anthony Kubiak, Daniel Listoe, Clark Lunberry, Bonnie Marranca, Peggy Phelan, Joseph Roach, Richard Schechner, Morton Subotnick, Julie Taymor, and Gregory Whitehead, respond to Blau's fierce and polymorphous intellect, his relentless drive and determination, and his audacity, his authority, to think, as he frequently insisted, "at the very nerve ends of thought."  aSponsored by University of Ottawa1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported licenseuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aAugmented reality. 0aComputer vision. 0aHistoryxComputer-assisted instruction. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.1 iSupplement (work):aKee, Kevin,tSeeing the Past with Computers.h1 online resource (30 digital images) 0aComp digital humanities series.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.996478602846nam a22003613i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000470012702400310017404000270020505000110023210000350024324501170027826400650039526400100046030000220047033600260049233700260051833800360054450400510058050502060063152012680083758800530210565000420215865000400220065000350224065500220227570000300229771000640232785600930239120180911185754.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180911t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124855qelectronic book  z9780472131266qhardcover :qalkaline paper7 a10.3998/mpub.100333192doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aKZ74951 aMeernik, James David,eauthor.10aJudging justice :bhow victim witnesses evaluate international courts /cJames David Meernik and Kimi Lynn King. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aIntroduction -- A Theory of Individual Evaluations of International Justice -- Identity, Trial Outcomes, and International Justice -- Fairness -- Wartime Experiences and Witness Efficacy -- Conclusion.3 aSome injustices are so massive, so heinous, and so extraordinary that ordinary courts are no longer adequate. The creation of international courts and tribunals to confront major violations of human rights sought to bring justice to affected communities as well as to the entire world. Yet if justice is a righting of the imbalance between what has happened and what is reflected in the law, no amount of punishment and no judgment could compensate for that suffering and loss. In order to understand the meaning of justice, James David Meernik and Kimi Lynn King studied the perspective of witnesses who have testified before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Using a unique survey, Meernik and King look at the identity of the victims and their perception of the fairness of ICTY. Because of the need to justify the practical and emotional difficulties involved in testifying before an international tribunal, witnesses look not just to the institution to judge its effectiveness, but also to their own contribution, by testifying effectively. The central elements of the theory Meernik and King develop-identity, fairness, and experience-transcend specific conflicts and countries and are of importance to people everywhere.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aVictims of crimes (International law) 0aWitnessesxLegal status, laws, etc. 0aInternational criminal courts. 4aElectronic books.1 aKing, Kimi Lynn,eauthor.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1003331903779nam a22004453i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702000290015602400300018504000270021504100130024205000190025510000280027424000320030224501890033426400650052326400150058830000350060333600260063833700260066433800360069049000250072652019460075158800530269765000470275065000700279765000560286765500220292370000330294570000370297870000380301570000320305370000340308571000640311983000580318385600920324120180914145838.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180912t20192019miu     o     000 0 eng d  a9780472124381qelectronic book  z9780472074068qhardcover  z9780472054060qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.97091522doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU1 aenghfre 4aPQ3989.2.N54460 aNimrod,d1959-eauthor.10aWorkskSelections.lEnglish10aNimrod :bselected works /cFrieda Ekotto, editor ; prose translated by Dawn Cornelio ; poetry translated by Catherine du Toit, Patrick Williamson, and Emily Goedde and Sylvie KandeÃÅ. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c{copy}2019  a1 online resource (248 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aAfrican perspectives3 aThe Chadian writer Nimrod-philosopher, poet, novelist, and essayist-is one of the most dynamic and vital voices in contemporary African literature and thought. Yet little of Nimrod's writing has been translated into English until now. Introductory material by Frieda Ekotto provides context for Nimrod's work and demonstrates the urgency of making it available beyond Francophone Africa to a broader global audience. At the heart of this volume are Nimrod's essays on LeÃÅopold SeÃÅdar Senghor, a key figure in the literary and aesthetic NeÃÅgritude movement of the 1930s and president of Senegal from 1945 through 1980. Widely dismissed in recent decades as problematically essentialist, Senghorian Negritude articulated notions of "blackness" as a way of transcending deep divisions across a Black Diaspora under French colonial rule. Nimrod offers a nuanced reading of Senghor, drawing out the full complexities of Senghor's philosophy and reevaluating how race and colonialism function in a French-speaking space. Also included in this volume are Nimrod's essays on literature from the 2008 collection, The New French Matter (La nouvelle chose francÃßaise). Representing his prose fiction is his 2010 work, Rivers' Gold (L'or des rivieÃÄres). Also featured are some of Nimrod's best-loved poems, in both English translation and the original French. The works selected and translated for this volume showcase Nimrod's versatility, his intellectual liveliness, and his exploration of questions of aesthetics in African literature, philosophy, and linguistics. Nimrod: Selected Writings marks a significant contribution toward engaging a broader audience with one of the vital voices of our time. This book will be essential reading for Anglophone students and scholars of African philosophy, literature, poetry, and critical theory, and will offer a welcome introduction to Nimrod for general readers of contemporary international writing.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aChadian literature (French)y20th century. 0aChadian literature (French)y20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aAfrican literature (French)xHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.1 aCornelio, Dawn,etranslator.1 aDu Toit, Catherine,etranslator.1 aWilliamson, Patrick,etranslator.1 aGoedde, Emily,etranslator.1 aKandeÃÅ, Sylvie,etranslator.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aAfrican perspectives (University of Michigan.

By focusing on the role Chinese classics (kanbun) played in the language employed by elite women, the chapters focus on how Empress Haruko, Shoen, and Shimoda Utako contributed new expectations for how women should participate in a modernizing Japan. By being in the public eye, all three women countered criticism of and commentary on their writings and activities, which they parried by navigating gender constraints. The success or failure as women ascribed to these three figures sheds light on the contradictions inhabited by them during a transformative period for Japanese women. By proposing and interrogating the possibility of Meiji women's power, the book examines contradictions that were symptomatic of their struggles within the vast social, cultural, and political transformations that took place during the period. The book demonstrates that an examination of that conflict within feminist history is crucial in order to understand what radical resistance meant in the face of women-centered authority.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aJapanxHistoryyMeiji period, 1868-1912. 0aWomenxEducationzJapanxHistory.00aShoÃÑken,cEmpress, consort of Meiji, Emperor of Japan,d1850-1914.10aNakajima, ShoÃÑen,d1863-1901.10aShimoda, Utako,d1854-1936. 0aJapanxSocial life and customsy1868-1912. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aMichigan monograph series in Japanese studies ;v[86].40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.985645302684nam  2200349Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204024003100233035002200264050001100286100003300297245009000330264006400420300005100484336002600535337002600561338003600587504005100623520136400674588005302038650003702091650002602128655002202154710006502176856009302241on107657408620181130093740.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181130s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472125081qelectronic book  a0472125087qelectronic book  z9780472131303qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.100757022doi  a(OCoLC)1076574086 4aML35081 aLewis, Eric,d1961-eauthor.10aIntents and purposes :bphilosophy and the aesthetics of improvisation /cEric Lewis. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (248 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aHow do we define improvised music? What is the relationship of highly improvised performances to the work they are performances of? How do we decide what are the important parts of an improvised musical work? In Intents and Purposes, Eric Lewis uses a series of case studies to challenge assumptions about what defines a musical work and musical performance, seeking to go beyond philosophical and aesthetic templates from Western classical music to foreground the distinctive practices and aesthetics of jazz. Pushing aside the assumption that composition and improvisation are different (or even opposed) musical practices, Lewis' philosophically informed approach revisits key topics in musical ontology, such as how to define the triangle of composer-performer-listener, and the status of live performances in relation to scores and recordings. Drawing on critical race theory, feminist theory, new musicology, sociology, cognitive science, and genre theory, Lewis opens up new questions about agency in performance, as well as new ways of considering the historical relationships between improvisational practices with roots in different cultural frameworks. By showing how jazz can be both art, idea, and action all at the same time, Lewis offers a new way of seeing any improvised musical performance in a new culturally and aesthetically rich context.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aJazzxPhilosophy and aesthetics. 0aImprovisation (Music) 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1007570202680nam  2200409Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020002900204024003000233035002200263043001200285050001100297100003100308245012300339264006700462264001000529300005100539336002600590337002600616338003600642504005100678520105100729588005301780650005101833650006301884650006501947650005202012650002702064655002202091710006502113856009202178on107657428020181130093831.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181130t20192019miua    ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124374qelectronic book  a0472124374qelectronic book  z9780472131051qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.99585742doi  a(OCoLC)1076574280  an-us--- 4aPN22481 aMielke, Laura L.,eauthor.10aProvocative eloquence :btheater, violence, and antislavery speech in the antebellum United States /cLaura L.

Slavery's defenders often used brute force to suppress opponents, and even those abolitionists dedicated to pacifism drew upon visions of widespread destruction. Provocative Eloquence recounts how the theater, long an arena for heightened eloquence and physical contest, proved terribly relevant in the lead up to the Civil War. As antislavery speech and open conflict intertwined, the nation became a stage. The book brings together notions of intertextuality and interperformativity to understand how the confluence of oratorical and theatrical practices in the antebellum period reflected the conflict over slavery and deeply influenced the language that barely contained that conflict. The book draws on a wide range of work in performance studies, theater history, black performance theory, oratorical studies, and literature and law to provide a new narrative of the interaction of oratorical, theatrical, and literary histories of the nineteenth-century U.S.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aTheaterzUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aTheater and societyzUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aAntislavery movementszUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aRhetoriczUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aSlavery in literature. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.995857403578nam  2200349Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003700137020003400174020003100208020003100239024003000270043001200300050001600312100002800328245003900356264006500395300003400460336002600494337002600520338003600546520197800582520038302560588005702943650005203000655002203052710006203074856009203136on108214635320190114040044.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190114s2019    miu     o     000 0 eng d  aEYMbengepnerdacEYMdEYM  a9780472125913q(electronic book)  a0472125915q(electronic book)  z9780472074266q(hardcover)  z9780472054268q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.44541292doi  an-us-mi 4aML3508.8.D41 aStryker, Mark,eauthor.10aJazz from Detroit /cMark Stryker. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019]  a1 online resource (277 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  a"Jazz from Detroit" is the first book to explore the city's profound influence on the course of modern and contemporary jazz from the mid-20th Century until the present day. In vivid prose that brings the music alive for both aficionados and newcomers, Mark Stryker details the lives and impact of more than two dozen key musicians, while also connecting the dots between players, eras, styles and the turbulent history of Detroit. The book explores how Detroit became a center for modern jazz and sustained its influence over decades -- graduating scores of musicians to the national scene and a striking number of innovators into the pantheon. A unique confluence of economic, cultural, educational and artistic factors transformed the Detroit into a bebop factory in the 1940s and '50s. The auto industry created a thriving black working and middle class in Detroit that supported a vibrant nightlife. Meanwhile, the marriage of superb formal instruction in public schools with the informal academy that legendary pianist and guru Barry Harris ran in his home had a catalytic impact on jazz in Detroit. Musicians rolled off an assembly line, all part of a unified fleet yet each a one-of-a-kind model with its own distinctive identity --  Hank, Thad and Elvin Jones, Milt Jackson, Yusef Lateef, Donald Byrd, Curtis Fuller, Kenny Burrell, Tommy Flanagan, Ron Carter and Joe Henderson coming to prominence. Musician-led cooperatives and self-determination efforts helped keep jazz flourishing in Detroit during the 1960s and '70s. In recent decades, even as the city's population fell sharply and economic might waned, Detroit continued to export significant talent to the major leagues. Detroit's culture of mentorship, embodied by trumpeter and teacher Marcus Belgrave, ensured that the city remained a national power as prot‚eg‚es like Geri Allen, Kenny Garrett, Robert Hurst, Regina Carter, Gerald Cleaver helped defined jazz in the late 20th and early 21st Centuries.  aCommon lineage and shared musical values link Detroit jazz musicians into an extended family defined by an allegiance to blues and swing, versatility, polished technique, musical intelligence and soulful expression. The ongoing resilience of Detroit's jazz tradition provides a powerful symbol of the city's lasting cultural influence and a metaphor for its nascent renaissance.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aJazzzMichiganzDetroitxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.445412902706nam  2200313Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003700137020003400174020003100208024003000239050001100269100003000280245007000310264006500380300003400445336002600479337002600505338003600531520154900567588005702116600004302173655002202216710006202238856009202300on108214627020190114040044.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190114s2019    miu     ob    000 0beng d  aEYMbengepnerdacEYMdEYM  a9780472125265q(electronic book)  a0472125265q(electronic book)  z9780472131389q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.99457322doi 4aPR45171 aBourrier, Karen,eauthor.10aVictorian bestseller :bthe life of Dinah Craik /cKaren Bourrier 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019]  a1 online resource (355 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  a"When novelist Dinah Craik (1826-87) died, expressions of grief came from Lord Alfred Tennyson, Matthew Arnold, Robert Browning, T.H. Huxley, and James Russell Lowell, among others, and even Queen Victoria picked up her pen to offer her consolation to the widower. Despite Craik's enormous popularity throughout a literary career that spanned forty years, she is now all but forgotten. Yet, in an otherwise respectable life bookended by scandal, this was precisely the way that she wanted it. Victorian Bestseller tells the story of Dinah Craik's remarkable life for the first time. Combining extensive archival work with theoretical work in disability studies and the professionalization of women's authorship, Karen Bourrier engagingly traces the contours of this author's life. Craik not only wrote extensively about disability but her personal and professional life was also marked by experience with mental and physical disability, and the ebb and flow of health. Following scholarship in the ethics of care and disability studies, the book posits Craik as an interdependent subject, placing her within a network of writers, publishers, editors and artists, friends, and family members. Victorian Bestseller also traces the conditions in the material history of the book, from steam-powered presses to illustrated magazines, that allowed Victorian women writers' careers to flourish. In doing so, the biography connects corporeality, gender, and the material history of the book to the professionalization of Victorian women's authorship."  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aCraik, Dinah Maria Mulock,d1826-1887. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.994573202998nam  2200361Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003700132020003400169020003100203024003100234043001200265050001100277049000900288100002900297245007200326264006500398264001000463300003400473336002600507337002600533338003600559504005100595520170500646588005302351651005202404655002202456710006502478856009302543on108631928020190219024757.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190219t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472125722q(electronic book)  a0472125729q(electronic book)  z9780472131440q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.101686822doi  ae-uk--- 4aUA 647  aEYMG1 aColley, Thomas,eauthor.10aAlways at war :bBritish public narratives of war /cThomas Colley. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (238 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 a"This book studies strategic narratives from the perspective of ordinary citizens from the bottom up. It examines the stories told by a broad cross-section of British society about their country's past, present, and future role in war, using in-depth interviews with 67 diverse citizens. The open-ended and inductive approach brings to the fore the voices of ordinary people in ways typically absent in existing public opinion research. In this respect, it models a qualitative, narrative methodological approach applicable to a range of countries and foreign policy issues. Compelling narratives are considered integral to successful foreign policy, military strategy, and international relations. Often narrative is conceived so broadly it represents all discourse, making it hard to identify. Thomas Colley separates narrative from other modes of discourse, and the way individual events combine to create overall patterns. Research on 'strategic narratives' has focused overwhelmingly on states, while citizens' narratives are rarely examined. The formation of strategic narratives is informed by the stories governments think their people tell, rather than those they actually tell. One unexpected finding was that rather than perceiving distinct periods between war and peace, its citizens see Britain as so frequently involved in conflict that they consider the country to be continuously at war. At present, public opinion appears to be a stronger constraint on Western defence policy than ever. Always at War complements a small but significant body of quantitative research into British attitudes to war, and presents an alternative case in a field dominated by US public opinion research."  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aGreat BritainxMilitary policyxPublic opinion. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1016868202847nam  2200421Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003700132020003400169020003100203020003100234024003000265043001200295050001200307049000900319100002700328245009200355264006500447264001000512300005200522336002600574337002600600338003600626490002500662504005100687520131400738588005302052650002702105650002802132650002902160655002202189710006502211830005702276856009202333on108631928120190219024757.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190219t20192019miua    ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472125708q(electronic book)  a0472125702q(electronic book)  z6780472074198q(hardcover)  z9780472054190q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.99555212doi  af------ 4aHV 4877  aEYMG1 aMwangi, Evan,eauthor.14aThe postcolonial animal :bAfrican literature and posthuman ethics /cEvan Maina Mwngi. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (255 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aAfrican perspectives  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 a"In this book, Evan Maina Mwangi assembles a wide range of contemporary texts to explore the interface of postcolonial writing, posthuman theory, and human-animal studies in Africanist contexts. Topics include the engagement with animals in indigenous ethics; representations of animals in modern texts based on African folklore; treatments of insects and small animals in African art; interspecies sex; and the deployment of animals as narrators and narrative agents. The book also considers animals as cultural signifiers of class, race, gender, and sexuality in works from Africa and its black diaspora. The book demonstrates that the human is not separated from other agencies in the universe, making it a central feature of the way African writers represent animals in literary texts. Writers discussed include such well-known artists and intellectuals such as Nuruddin Farah, Ng‰ug‰iwa Thiong'o, J.M. Coetzee, Charles Mungoshi, Jan Carew, and Zakes Mda. Emergent or less-discussed writers like Yuda Komora, Henry ole Kulet, Grace Ogot, Patrice Nganang, and Rebecca Nandwa are also given consideration. Repurposing Rosi Braidotti and other theorists of posthumanism, Mwangi advocates an egalitarian ethics in its unconditional acceptance of nonhuman others for their authenticity in being what they are."  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aAnimal rightszAfrica. 0aAnimal welfarezAfrica. 0aPostcolonialismzAfrica. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aAfrican perspectives (University of Michigan.

The first, coming from popular culture fictions about politics, the second coming from academic theories about government, particularly the assumptions of mainstream U.S. political science. Stephen Benedict Dyson argues that fictions and theories both function as attempts at meaning making - making sensible the otherwise insensible realm of political behavior. By taking fiction seriously, and by arguing that political science theory is homologous to fictions, the book offers a radical new perspective on both. The specialist is challenged to think anew not just about fictions such as The West Wing, House of Cards, Borgen, Black Mirror, and Scandal, but about the assumptions that construct the discipline of political science itself. It is also about our political moment. The two populist shocks of our time - Brexit and the election of Trump - are set in a new context here as we trace the development of an image of politics as an insider game through fictions and academic theory, and look at how Brexit and Trump took on that image, and won.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPolitics on television. 0aPolitical science. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1019180202444nam  2200373Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003500132020003200167020002900199024003000228043001200258050001100270049000900281100003300290245009800323264006400421300005100485336002600536337002600562338003600588504005100624520104100675588005301716650004201769650004401811650003601855655002201891710006501913856009201978on108889266720190301092627.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190301s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472125234qelectronic book  a0472125230qelectronic book  z9780472131372qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.97690822doi  aa-cc--- 4aPL2357  aEYMG1 aLei, Daphne Pi-Wei,eauthor.10aUncrossing the borders :bperforming Chinese in gendered (trans)nationalism /cDaphne P.

Uncrossing the Borders asks why this theatrical trope has remained so powerful and attractive. The book analyzes how national, cultural, and ethnic borders are inevitably gendered and incite violence against women in the name of the nation. The book surveys two millennia of historical, literary, dramatic texts and sociopolitical references to reveal that this type of drama was especially popular when China was under foreign rule, such as in the Yuan (Mongol) and Qing (Manchu) dynasties, and when Chinese male literati felt desperate about their economic and political future, due to the dysfunctional imperial examination system.

Lei covers border-crossing Chinese drama in major theatrical genres such as zaju and chuanqi, regional drama such as jingju (Beijing opera) and yueju (Cantonese opera), and modernized operatic and musical forms of such stories today.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aChinese dramaxHistory and criticism. 0aOperas, ChinesexHistory and criticism. 0aWomenxViolence againstzChina. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.976908202885nam  2200349Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003500132020003200167020002900199024003100228050001000259049000900269100002400278245007700302264006400379300003400443336002600477337002600503338003600529504005100565520165500616588005302271650001502324650001602339655002202355710006502377856009302442on108889307420190301092627.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190301s2019    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472125920qelectronic book  a0472125923qelectronic book  z9780472131525qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.113006562doi 4aJC423  aEYMG1 aLi, Yuhui,eauthor.10aDividing the rulers :bhow majority cycling saves democracy /cYuhui Li. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (144 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aThe idea of democracy is under enormous challenge in the recent years, especially since the election of many populist politicians who run a platform of pleasing electoral winners at the expense of the losers. This book argues that majority rule itself is not to blame, but the institutional features that stabilize majorities are responsible. Despite the popular idea that social choice instability (or "cycling") makes it impossible for majorities to make optimal decisions, Yuhui Li argues that the best part of democracy is not the large number of people on the winning side, but that the winners can be easily divided and realigned with losers in the cycling process. He shows that minorities' bargaining power depends on their ability to exploit the division within the winning coalition and induce its members to defect, an institutionalized uncertainty that is missing in one-party authoritarian systems. The reason that certain democracies lost their institutional advantage to non-democracies is often that their institutions make it too hard for the winning coalition to divide and break down. Using simple reasoning with the help of experimental and observational data, Dividing the Rulers theorizes and simulates why such division within the majority is important and what kind of institutional features can help a democratic system maintain such division, which is crucial in preventing an undefeatable winning coalition and the "tyranny of the majority" that may come with it. These institutional solutions point to a direction of institutional reform that not only academics, but also politicians and voters should collectively pursue.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aDemocracy. 0aMajorities. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1130065603035nam  2200445Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003500132020003200167020002900199020002900228024003000257050001600287049000900303100003000312245008100342264006400423300005200487336002600539337002600565338003600591490002400627504005100651520140200702588005302104610002402157610001802181650002802199650004302227650004302270650003802313650003402351655002202385710006502407830002502472856009202497on108889307520190301092627.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190301s2019    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472124329qelectronic book  a0472124323qelectronic book  z9780472074020qhardcover  z9780472054022qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.95362862doi 4aHD9349.S634  aEYMG1 aLove, Joanna K.,eauthor.10aSoda goes pop :bPepsi-Cola advertising and popular music /cJoanna K.

It historicizes and analyzes widely disseminated Pepsi commercials for its signature and diet colas, focusing largely on well-known television spots and charting their evolution from featuring stand-alone, broadcast jingles to celebrities singing the latest pop songs and styles in its campaigns. This book integrates close musical analysis with interdisciplinary scholarship on advertising and American popular culture to examine the process of redaction -- the practice marketers have used to select, censor, and restructure musical texts to fit commercial contexts in ways that revise their aesthetic meanings and serve corporate aims. It argues that it was advertising's ability to get inside musical texts that eventually allowed corporate brands to play key roles in popular music's dissemination and production. This book investigates how Pepsi-Cola marketing has historically appropriated meanings from hit songs and celebrity musical endorsers, what new meanings its well-known spots attempted to emit, and why these commercials shaped future relationships between the American music business, the advertising industry, and corporate brands.  aDescription based on information from publisher.20aPepsi-Cola Company.20aPepsiCo, Inc. 0aCola drinksxMarketing. 0aTelevision commercialszUnited States. 0aTelevision advertisingzUnited States. 0aAdvertisingxBrand name products. 0aPopular musiczUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aTracking pop series.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.953628602764nam  2200409Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003500132020003200167020002900199024003100228050001100259049000900270100003100279245009400310264006400404300003400468336002600502337002600528338003600554504005100590520111200641588005301753650005101806650005101857650003801908650005601946650005602002651005802058651005802116655002202174710006502196856009302261on108889307620190301092627.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190301s2019    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472125791qelectronic book  a0472125796qelectronic book  z9780472131471qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.101517182doi 4aPN2594  aEYMG1 aMeeuwis, Michael,eauthor.10aEveryone's theater :bliterature and daily life in England, 1860-1914 /cMichael Meeuwis. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019.  a1 online resource (216 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aNearly all residents of England and its colonies between 1860 and 1914 were active theatergoers, and many participated in the amateur theatricals that defined late-Victorian life. The Victorian theater was not an abstract figuration of the world as a stage, but a media system enmeshed in mass lived experience that fulfilled in actuality the concept of a theatergoing nation. Everyone's Theater turns to local history, the words of everyday Victorians found in their diaries and production records, to recover this lost chapter of theater history in which amateur drama domesticates the stage. Professional actors and playwrights struggled to make their productions compatible with ideas and techniques that could be safely reproduced in the home -- and in amateur performances from Canada to India. This became the first true English national theater: a society whose myriad classes found common ground in theatrical display. Everyone's Theater provides new ways to extend Victorian literature into the dimension of voice, sound, and embodiment, and to appreciate the pleasures of Victorian theatricality.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aTheaterzGreat BritainxHistoryy19th century. 0aTheaterzGreat BritainxHistoryy20th century. 0aTheater audienceszGreat Britain. 0aEnglish dramay19th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aEnglish dramay20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aGreat BritainxSocial life and customsy19th century. 0aGreat BritainxSocial life and customsy20th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1015171803933nam  2200373Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003600132020003300168020004400201020004100245024003000286050001100316049000900327100003400336245010200370264006400472264001000536300005100546336002600597337002600623338003600649504005600685505066000741520189701401588005703298650002803355655002203383710006203405856009203467on108994128720190315023136.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190315t20192019miua    ob    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengepnerdacEYM  a9780472125180q(electronic bk.)  a0472125184q(electronic bk.)  a9780472131327q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a047213132Xq(hardcover : alk. paper)7 a10.3998/mpub.98530482doi 4aHJ3801  aEYMG1 aBraunstein, Juergen,eauthor.10aCapital choices :bsectoral politics and the variation of sovereign wealth /cJuergen Braunstein. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019. 4c√2019  a1 online resource (193 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 159-192)0 aAbbreviations -- Acknowledgments -- Chapter 1.

The dramatic rise of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) in terms of number and size -- this group is now larger than the combined size of global private equity and hedge funds -- and that the majority of them are located in non-OECD countries, has raised concern about the future direction of capitalism. Yet SWFs are not a homogenous group of actors. Why do some countries with large current account surpluses, notably China, create SWFs while others, such as Switzerland and Germany, don't? Why do other countries with no macro-economic justification, such as Senegal and Turkey, create SWFs? And why do countries with very similar macro-economic features, such as Kuwait and Qatar or Singapore and Hong Kong, choose very different types of SWFs? Capital Choices analyzes the struggles behind the creation of different SWFs from a comparative political economy perspective. Examining small open economies, the book argues that different state-society structures at the sectoral level are the core drivers responsible for SWF variation. Juergen Braunstein looks inside the 'black box' of SWF creation, focusing on the early formation period of SWFs: a critical but little understood area in the current debate, given high levels of political sensitivity and a lack of transparency. Braunstein's novel analytical framework provides practical lessons for business and finance organizations, as well as for policy makers of countries that have created or are planning to create SWFs. This book illustrates the scope for the domestic politics and strategies of small states in economic policy despite strong transnational forces, notably international economic and diffusion pressures."  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aSovereign wealth funds. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.985304804023nam  2200433Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003600132020003300168020004400201020004100245020003100286020002800317024003000345043001200375050001400387049000900401100003200410245011500442264006400557264001000621300003500631336002600666337002600692338003600718490004200754504005700796505061200853520181701465588005703282650003803339650003603377655002203413710006203435856009203497on108994779020190315023136.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190315t20192019miu     ob    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengepnerdacEYM  a9780472125593q(electronic bk.)  a0472125591q(electronic bk.)  a9780472074174q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a0472074172q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472054176q(paperback)  a0472054171q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.99693672doi  aa-ja--- 4aLB3067.J3  aEYMG1 aBullock, Julia C.,eauthor.10aCoeds ruining the nation :bwomen, education, and social change in postwar Japanese media /cJulia C.

Boys would be prepared to enter a rapidly modernizing public sphere, while girls trained to become 'good wives and wise mothers' who would contribute to the nation by supporting their husbands and nurturing the next generation of imperial subjects. When this system was replaced by a coeducational model during the American Occupation following World War II, adults raised with gender-specific standards were afraid coeducation would cause 'moral problems' even societal collapse. By contrast, young people generally greeted coeducation with greater composure. This is the first book in English to explore the arguments for and against coeducation as presented in newspaper and magazine articles, cartoons, student-authored school newsletters, and roundtable discussions published in the Japanese press as these reforms were being implemented. It complicates the notion of the postwar years as a moment of rupture, highlighting prewar experiments with coeducation that belied objections that the practice was a foreign imposition and therefore 'unnatural' for Japanese culture. It also illustrates a remarkable degree of continuity between prewar and postwar models of femininity, arguing that Occupation-era guarantees of equal educational opportunity were ultimately repurposed toward a gendered division of labor that underwrote the postwar project of economic recovery. Finally, it excavates discourses of gender and sexuality underlying the moral panic surrounding coeducation to demonstrate that claims of rampant sexual deviance and other concerns were employed as disciplinary mechanisms to reinforce an ideology of harmonious gender complementarity and to dissuade women from pursuing conventionally masculine prerogatives."  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aCoeducationzJapany20th century. 0aEducationzJapany20th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.996936702768nam  2200397Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003600132020003300168020004400201020004100245024003100286050001100317049000900328100003800337245009600375264006400471264001000535300003500545336002600580337002600606338003600632490002800668504005600696505052400752520079601276588005702072650003202129650003202161655002202193710006202215856009302277on108994798920190315023136.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190315t20192019miu     ob    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengepnerdacEYM  a9780472125760q(electronic bk.)  a0472125761q(electronic bk.)  a9780472131464q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a047213146Xq(hardcover : alk. paper)7 a10.3998/mpub.100945732doi 4aPN2075  aEYMG1 aHoltcamp, Victor Roland,eauthor.10aInterchangeable parts :bacting, industry, and technology in US theater /cVictor Holtcamp. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019. 4c√2019  a1 online resource (379 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aTheory/Text/Performance  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 360-379)0 aIntroduction: Immune to Luck -- Chapter 1: A Dream of Scales -- Chapter 2: Taylor and the Experimental Theatre Company, Inc. -- Chapter 3: Cogs in the Wheel -- Chapter 4: "Are You Willing to Work Hard?"

Drawing from interviews, archives, and close readings of the textual legacy of major and lesser-known teachers and theoreticians, Holtcamp narrates the story of how actors learned to learn to act, and what that process, for both stage and screen, owed to the interchangeable parts and mass production revolutions of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries."  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aActingxStudy and teaching. 0aTechnologyxSocial aspects. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1009457304551nam  2200433Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003600132020003300168020004400201020004100245020004000286020003700326024003000363050001700393049000900410100003600419245007000455264006400525264001000589300003500599336002600634337002600660338003600686490001900722504006700741505078100808520182601589520037003415588005703785650005303842650004603895655002203941710006203963856009204025on108994779120190315023136.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190315t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengepnerdacEYM  a9780472125715q(electronic bk.)  a0472125710q(electronic bk.)  a9780472074204q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a0472074202q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472054206q(paper : alk. paper)  a0472054201q(paper : alk. paper)7 a10.3998/mpub.95334682doi 4aPN1009.5.C44  aEYMG1 aWheeler, Elizabeth A.,eauthor.10aHandiLand :bthe crippest place on Earth /cElizabeth A.

These books take what others regard as weaknesses -- for instance, Harry Potter's headaches or Hazel Lancaster's oxygen tank -- and redefine them as part of the hero's journey. HandiLand places this movement from sidekick to hero in the political contexts of disability rights movements in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Ghana. HandiLand moves through the public spaces young people with disabilities have entered, including schools, nature, and online communities. How does Afrofuturist science fiction shed light on the Flint water crisis? How does Harry Potter strengthen fans struggling with depression? How does Wonder offers strategies for entering a new school with a visible disability? As a disabled person and parent of children with disabilities, Wheeler offers an inside look into families who collude with their kids in shaping a better world. The theoretical strengths of HandiLand include its environmental ethic, its concept of the prosthetic community, and its vision of disability as a spectrum of privilege. Disability serves as a model for environmental thinking that transcends the human mastery of nature and the borders of species. Too often, young characters have to earn their inclusion through exceptional charm, spotless character, heroic feats, or white privilege. The only way to transcend this tokenism, Wheeler argues, is to grant all young people access to a prosthetic community, defined as a cluster of living beings, objects, resources, technologies, and ideas that enable a decent life. The lack of prosthetic community leaves children vulnerable to sexual assault and police brutality.3 aYoung people with disabilities live on a spectrum of privilege according to race, class, gender identity, and type of disability. Wheeler invokes the fantasy of HandiLand, an ideal society ready for young people with disabilities before they get there, as a yardstick to measure how far we've come and how far we still need to go toward the goal of total inclusion.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aChildren with disabilitiesvJuvenile literature. 0aChildren with disabilities in literature. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.953346803321nam  2200421Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003700132020003400169020003100203020002800234024003000262043001200292050001500304049000900319100003600328245009300364264010800457264001000565300005200575336002600627337002600653338003600679490007300715504005600788588005700844520165600901650004102557651002402598655002202622700004002644710004902684830007402733856009202807on109072714720190327083835.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190327t20192019miua    ob    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472125616q(electronic book)  a0472125613q(electronic book)  a9780472131433q(hardcover)  a0472131435q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.98520752doi  ae-it--- 4aDG 70 .C63  aEY2L1 aWill, Elizabeth Lydingeauthor.10aCosa :bthe Roman and Greek Amphoras /cElizabeth Lyding Will and Kathleen Warner Slane. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bPublished for the American Acedmy n Rome by University of Michigan Press,c2019. 4c√2019  a1 online resource (304 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aMemoirs of the American Academy in Rome.

This town has been widely recognized as a prototypical colony of the later Roman Republic and a source for trade with Gaul and Spain, so this publication of its finds has important implications for archaeologists and historians of the ancient world. Will's initial work was on Latin amphora-stamps in the eastern Mediterranean, and through the 1960s and 1970s she developed an amphora typology based on materials found in the region and at Cosa. What has not been appreciated is that this typology was not limited to stamped Republican amphoras but also included unstamped vessels, such as imperial Spanish, African, and eastern amphoras dating as late as the fifth century CE. This book shows that Will was far ahead of her time in documenting the Mediterranean trade in commodities carried in amphoras: her work not only provides a record of the amphoras found on the town-site of Cosa, but also includes a comparison between the finds from the port and the town. At the time of Will's death, her manuscript consisted of a typed catalogue of the amphora stamps from Cosa and an equal number of unstamped vessels, but was missing important elements. On the basis of extensive notes and photographs, Kathleen Warner Slane has reviewed and updated the manuscript, adding type descriptions and footnotes to materials that have appeared since Will's death as well as a framing introduction and conclusions. Appendices highlight an Augustan amphora dump on the Arx and add a catalogue of the Greek amphora stamps found at Cosa. 0aAmphoraszItalyzCosa (Extinct city) 0aCosa (Extinct city) 4aElectronic books.1 aSlane, Kathleen W.,d1949-eauthor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan) 0aMemoirs of the American Academy in Rome.pSupplementary volume ;v14.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.975207504392nam  2200409Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003700132020003400169020003100203020003100234024003000265043001200295050001600307049000900323100002500332245008900357264006500446264001000511300005800521336002600579337002600605338003600631490003900667504005100706588005700757520287200814651004403686651004003730650003603770655002203806710006203828856009203890on109072714820190327083845.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190327t20192019miuab    b    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472125586q(electronic book)  a0472125583q(electronic book)  z9780472074167q(hardcover)  z9780472054168q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.97521162doi  aa-kr--- 4aDS 925 .S45  aEY2L1 aCho, Mihye,eauthor.10aEntrepreneurial Seoulite :bculture and subjectivity in Hongdae, Seoul /cMihye Cho. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (168 pages) :billustrations, maps.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aPerspectives on contemporary Korea  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.  aEntrepreneurial Seoulite might be read as a memoir on Hongdae based on the author's observations as a member of South Korea's Generation X. During the 1990's, Hongdae became widely known as a cool place associated with discourses on alternative music, independent labels, and club culture. Today, Hongdae is well known for its youth culture and nightlife, as well as its gentrification. Recent research on Korean culture approaches the K-wave phenomenon from the perspectives of cultural consumption, media analysis, and cultural management and policy. Meanwhile, studies on Seoul have centered on its transformation as a global, creative city. Rather than examining the K-wave or the city itself, this book explores the experience of living through the city-in-transition, focusing on the relationship between "the ideology that justified engagement in capitalism" and the "subjectification process." The book aims to understand the project to institutionalize a cultural district in Hongdae as a demonstration of the coevolution of ideologies and citizenship in a society undergoing rapid liberalization--politically, culturally, and economically. A cultural turn took place in Korea during the 1990s, amid the economic prosperity driven by state-led industrialization and the collapse of the military dictatorship due to democratization movements. Cultural critiques, emerging as an alternative to social movements, proliferated to assert the freedom and autonomy of individuals against regulatory systems and institutions. The nation was hit by the Asian financial crisis in 1997, and witnessed massive economic restructuring including layoffs, stakeouts, and a prevalence of contingent employment. As a result, the entire nation had to find new engines of economic growth while experiencing a creative destruction. At the center of this national transformation, Seoul has sought to recreate itself from a mega city to a global city, equipped with cutting-edge knowledge industries and infrastructures. By juxtaposing the cultural turn and cultural/creative city-making, Entrepreneurial Seoulite interrogates the formation of new citizen subjectivity, namely the enterprising self, in post-Fordist Seoul. What kinds of logic guide individuals in the engagement of new urban realities in rapidly liberalized Seoul--culturally and economically? In order to explore this query, Mihye Cho draws on Weber's concept of "the spirit of capitalism" on the formation of a new economic agency focusing on the re-configuration of meanings, and seeks to capture a transformative moment detailing when and how capitalism requests a different spirit and lifestyle of its participants. Likewise, this book approaches the enterprising self as the new spirit of post-Fordist Seoul and explores the ways in which people in Seoul internalize and negotiate this new enterprising self. 0aSeoul (Korea)xSocial life and customs. 0aSeoul (Korea)xEconomic conditions. 0aEntrepreneurshipzKoreazSeoul. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.975211602899nam  2200397Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003100132020003700163020003400200024003000234043001200264050001100276049000900287100002900296245009900325264006500424264001000489300003400499336002600533337002600559338003600585504006700621505063400688520081101322588005702133650002402190650005102214650005702265655002202322710006502344856009202409on109119304520190402013637.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190402t20192019miu      b    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  z9780472131419q(hardcover)  a9780472125326q(electronic book)  a047212532Xq(electronic book)7 a10.3998/mpub.93734852doi  an-us--- 4aPN4151  aEYMG1 aBean, Heidi R.,eauthor.10aActs of poetry :bAmerican poets' theater and the politics of performance /cby Heidi R.

American poet's theater proliferated in the postwar period, when rich, performance-oriented poetry and theater scenes came together on the makeshift stages of urban coffee houses, shared apartments, and underground theaters. And yet its importance and history have been almost entirely ignored by critics. Acts of Poetry shines a spotlight on the practice of poet's theater by examining key groups and practitioners. Bringing together cultural history and criticism, it maps poet's theater in relation to performance practices such as poetry readings, avant-garde theater, and conceptual art and demonstrates not only the emergence of poet's theater in the postwar period but its continuation and legacy today.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPerformance poetry. 0aTheaterzUnited Statesy20th centuryxHistory. 0aAmerican dramay20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.937348502911nam  2200397Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003100132020003700163020003400200024003100234050001100265049000900276100002800285245008500313264006500398264001000463300003500473336002600508337002600534338003600560504006700596505034500663520108701008588005702095650004802152600004302200600004202243600004802285655002202333710006502355856009302420on109119304620190402013637.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190402t20192019miu      b    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  z9780472131488q(hardcover)  a9780472125821q(electronic book)  a0472125826q(electronic book)7 a10.3998/mpub.101520842doi 4aPN1851  aEYMG1 aBalkin, Sarah,eauthor.10aSpecial characters :bgenre and materiality on the modern stage /cSarah Balkin. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (178  pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 158-177) and index.0 aChapter 1: The spectral individual: Ibsen's dead realism -- Chapter 2: Imaginary characters: Wilde's unrealized personalities -- Chapter 3: Language and materiality: Strindberg's vampiric narrators -- Chapter 4: Old new materialisms: Monist dramatury in Strindberg's The Black Glove --Chapter 5: Modernist afterlives: Genet, Kopit, Beckett.3 aTheater's materiality and reliance on human actors has traditionally put it at odds with modernist principles of aesthetic autonomy and depersonalization. Spectral Characters argues that modern dramatists in fact emphasized the extent to which humans are fictional, made and changed by costumes, settings, props, and spoken dialogue. Examining work by Ibsen, Wilde, Strindberg, Genet, Kopit, and Beckett, the book takes up the apparent deadness of characters whose selves are made of other people, whose thoughts become exteriorized communication technologies, and whose bodies merge with walls and furniture. The ghostly, vampiric, and telepathic qualities of these characters, Sarah Balkin argues, mark a new relationship between the material and the imaginary in modern theater. By considering characters whose bodies respond to language, whose attempts to realize their individuality collapse into inanimacy, and who sometimes don't appear at all, the book posits a new genealogy of modernist drama that emphasizes its continuities with nineteenth-century melodrama and realism.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aDramay19th centuryxHistory and criticism.10aIbsen, Henrik,d1828-1906xCharacters.10aWilde, Oscar,d1854-1900xCharacters.10aStrindberg, August,d1849-1912xCharacters. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1015208403477nam  2200409Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003600132020003300168020004400201020003100245024003100276043001200307050001200319049000900331100004100340245010000381264006400481264001000545300003400555336002600589337002600615338003600641504006700677505072500744520121201469588005702681650005302738650006702791650003202858655002202890710006202912856009302974on109158408020190404105607.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190404t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengepnerdacEYM  a9780472125609q(electronic bk.)  a0472125605q(electronic bk.)  z9780472074181q(hardcover : alk. paper)  z9780472054183q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.100437822doi  an-us--- 4aE185.61  aEYMG1 aKnadler, Stephen P.,d1963-eauthor.10aVitality politics :bhealth, debility, and the limits of black emancipation /cStephen Knadler. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019. 4c√2019  a1 online resource (327 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 287-326) and index.0 aIntroduction: "Ill-Defined Emancipations"-- Chapter 1.

"Vitality" was a value for the American populace that was promulgated in the Progressive Era, following the model of the robustly healthy Theodore Roosevelt. Knadler explores how the goal of racial uplift in the period became associated with notions of African American vitality and debility, and traces these notions through a range of African American cultural production, particularly literature. The manuscript theorizes how these works "troubled and also redeployed a biopolitical management around slow violence, health, and disability central to the emergence of modern racial capitalism and liberal citizenship."Although the study focuses on the early twentieth century and writers of that era (e.g., Charles Chesnutt, W.E.B. Du Bois, Marita Bonner, Ann Petry, Angelina Grimke, Nella Larsen, Alain Locke, Jessie Fauset, Dorothy West), its conclusions are acutely relevant to today‚p0b9ss headlines, including the Black Lives Matter movement.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAfrican AmericansxCivil rightsxHealth aspects. 0aAmerican literaturexAfrican American authorsxHealth aspects. 0aBiopoliticszUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1004378204140nam  2200409Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003600132020003300168020004400201024003100245043001200276050001300288049000900301100003800310245011600348264006400464264001000528300003500538336002600573337002600599338003600625490005000661504005700711505091200768520173201680588005703412650003203469650002603501650002603527655002203553710006203575856009303637on109158408120190404105607.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190404t20192019miu     ob    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengepnerdacEYM  a9780472125852q(electronic bk.)  a0472125850q(electronic bk.)  z9780472131501q(hardcover : alk. paper)7 a10.3998/mpub.101915792doi  aa-io--- 4aJQ766.D4  aEYMG1 aShair-Rosenfield, Sarah,eauthor.10aElectoral reform and the fate of new democracies :blessons from the Indonesian case /cSarah Shair-Rosenfield. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019. 4c√2019  a1 online resource (213 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aWeiser Center for Emerging Democracies series  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 196-212).0 aPart I: Setting Up the Puzzle -- Chapter 1.

The incidence of such changes, known as major electoral reforms, has been on the rise since 1980. This has concerned scholars who typically assume strategic choices, rather than ideological or normative preferences for democracy, drive elite decision-making regarding electoral reform. Thus, reforms would likely limit democratic consolidation by allowing elite actors to reshape the electoral system to their advantage. Electoral Reform and the Fate of New Democracies argues that elite inexperience may constrain the pursuit of self-interest and lead elites to undertake gradual or incremental approaches to the process of reform, aiding the process of democratic consolidation. Using a multi-methods approach, the book examines three consecutive periods of reform in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim majority country and third largest democracy, between 1999 and 2014. Each case study chapter provides an in-depth process tracing of the negotiations leading to the adoption of new reforms, including key actors in the legislature, domestic civil society, international experts, and government bureaucrats. A series of counterfactual analyses assess the impact the reforms had on actual election outcomes versus the possible alternative outcomes of different reform options discussed during negotiations. With a comparative analysis of nine cases of iterated reform processes in other new democracies, the book confirms the lessons from the Indonesian case and highlights key lessons for both scholars and electoral engineers."  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aDemocratizationzIndonesia. 0aElectionszIndonesia. 0aDemocracyzIndonesia. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1019157903167nam  2200421Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003700132020003400169020003100203024003100234043001200265050001000277049000900287100002600296245012200322246007700444264006500521264001000586300005100596336002600647337002600673338003600699504008300735520131600818588005702134650006802191650007002259650007702329655002202406700004602428710006502474770016402539856004202703on109947044620190429014927.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190429t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472126033q(electronic book)  a0472126032q(electronic book)  z9780472131563q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.102091062doi  an------ 4aSH177  aEY2L1 aBrant, Cory,eauthor.10aGreat Lakes sea lamphrey :bthe 70 year war on a biological invader / $c Cory Brant, with a foreword by Jerry Dennis.31aGreat Lakes sea lamphrey :bthe seventy year war on a biological invader 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (129 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 112-122) and index (pages 122-129).3 aThe stuff of nightmares in both their looks and the horrifying wounds inflicted on their victims, sea lampreys are perhaps the deadliest invasive species to ever enter the Great Lakes. At the invasion's peak in the mid-20th century, annual catches of lake trout, the lampreys' preferred host fish in the Great Lakes, plummeted from 6.5 million pounds to a mere 11,000 pounds. Threatening the complete collapse of the fishery, the sea lamprey invasion triggered an environmental awakening across the region, prompting an international treaty that dissolved political boundaries in a cooperative effort to protect and rehabilitate the Great Lakes. The resulting war on Great Lakes sea lampreys fostered a pioneering scientific spirit leading to discoveries that are the backbone of a program that eventually brought the creature under control and now protects the largest freshwater ecosystem in the world. Great Lakes Sea Lamprey draws on extensive interviews with individuals who experienced the invasion firsthand as well as a trove of unexplored archival materials to tell the incredible story of sea lamprey in the Great Lakes. Richly illustrated with color and black & white photographs, the book will interest readers concerned with the health of the Great Lakes and the ongoing threat of invasive species.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPetromyzon marinusxControlzGreat Lakes Region (North America) 0aIntroduced organismsxControlzGreat Lakes Region (North America) 0aNonindigenous aquatic pestsxControlzGreat Lakes Region (North America) 4aElectronic books.1 aDennis, Jerry,d1954-ewriter of preface.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.08iSupplement (work) :aBrant, Cory.tGreat Lakes sea lamphrey : the 70 year war on a biological invader.h1 online resource (100 audio files, 700 digital images)40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1020910602557nam  2200397Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003700132020003400169020003100203024003100234043001200265050001600277049000900293100003200302245009300334264006500427264001000492300004500502336002600547337002600573338003600599504006800635520115200703588005701855600003301912650001701945651003801962650003002000655002202030710006502052856004202117on109947046120190429014927.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190429t20192019miu     ob    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472125937q(electronic book)  a0472125931q(electronic book)  z9780472131532q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.113012492doi  an-us--- 4aB945b.B124  aEY2L1 aSmith, William S.,eauthor.10aDemocracy and imperialism :bIrving Babbitt and warlike democracies /cWilliam S.

A central issue is whether an interventionist foreign policy is compatible with the American constitutional tradition. The book examines Irving Babbitt's (1865-1933) unique contribution to understanding the quality of foreign policy leadership in a democracy. Babbitt explored how a democratic nation's foreign policy is a product of the moral and cultural tendencies of the nation's leaders and that the substitution of expansive, sentimental Romanticism for the religious and ethical traditions of the West would lead to imperialism. The United States has been moving away from the restraining order of sound constitutionalism to impose its will on other nations, which will inevitably cause the United States to clash with the "civilizational" regions that have emerged in recent decades. Democracy and Imperialism brings the question of soul types to issues of foreign policy leadership and discusses the qualities in leaders that are necessary for sound foreign policy.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aBabbitt, Irving,d1865-1933. 0aImperialism. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relations. 0aDemocracyzUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1130124902663nam  2200421Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003700132020003400169020003100203020003100234024003000265043001200295050001900307049000900326100005000335245010900385264006500494264001000559300003400569336002600603337002600629338003600655490002500691504006700716520112200783588005701905650004101962651004502003651003902048655002202087710006502109830002602174856004102200on109947046220190429014927.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190429t20192019miu     ob    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472125241q(electronic book)  a0472125249q(electronic book)  z9780472074136q(hardcover)  z9780472054138q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.99552022doi  af-cm--- 4aHQ1236.5b.C17  aEY2L1 aMougou‚e, Jacqueline-Bethel Tchouta,eauthor.10aGender, separatist politics, and embodied nationalism in Cameroon /cJacqueline-Bethel Tchouta Mougou‚e. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (312 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aAfrican perspectives  aIncludes bibliographical references and index (pages 231-312).3 aGender, Separatist Politics, and Embodied Nationalism in Cameroon illuminates how issues of ideal womanhood shaped the Anglophone Cameroonian nationalist movement in the first decade of independence in Cameroon, a west-central African country. Drawing upon history, political science, gender studies, and feminist epistemologies, the book examines how formally educated women sought to protect the cultural values and the self-determination of the Anglophone Cameroonian state as Francophone Cameroon prepared to dismantle the federal republic. The book defines and uses the concept of embodied nationalism to illustrate the political importance of women's everyday behavior--the clothes they wore, the foods they cooked, whether they gossiped, and their deference to their husbands--in the project of demonstrating that West Cameroon, which comprised of English-Speaking regions, was a progressive and autonomous nation. Its sources include oral interviews and archival sources such as women's newspaper advice columns, Cameroon's first cooking book, and the first novel published by an Anglophone Cameroonian woman.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aWomenxPolitical activityzCameroon. 0aCameroonxPolitics and governmenty1960- 0aCameroonxSocial conditionsy1960- 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aAfrican perspectives.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.995520202590nam  2200373Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003700132020003400169020003100203024003000234043001200264050001800276049000900294100002800303245008700331264006500418264001000483300004500493336002600538337002600564338003600590504007800626520115700704588005701861600006201918650005401980655002202034710006502056856009502121on109947046320190429014927.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190429t20192019miu     ob    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472125876q(electronic book)  a0472125877q(electronic book)  z9780472131518q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.93858562doi  an-us--- 4aE175.5b.S342  aEY2L1 aLester, Emile,eauthor.10aLiberalism and leadership :bthe irony of Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. /cEmile Lester. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (233 unnumbered pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index (unnumbered pages 209-233).3 aMost scholars and pundits today view Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy as aggressive liberal leaders, while viewing Schlesinger's famous histories of their presidencies as celebrations of their steadfast progressive leadership. A more careful reading of Schlesinger's work demonstrates that he preferred an ironic political outlook emphasizing the virtues of restraint, patience, and discipline. For Schlesinger, Roosevelt and Kennedy were liberal heroes and models as much because they respected the constraints on their power and ideals as because they tested traditional institutions and redefined the boundaries of Presidential power.  Aggressive liberalism involves the use of inspirational rhetoric and cunning political tactics to expand civil liberties and insure economic equality. Schlesinger's emphasis on the crucial role that irony has played and should play in liberalism poses a challenge to the aggressive liberalism advocated by liberal activists, political thinkers, and pundits. That his counsel was grounded in conservative insights as well as liberal values makes it accessible to leaders across the political spectrum.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aSchlesinger, Arthur M.,cJr.q(Arthur Meier),d1917-2007. 0aLiberalismzUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3998/mpub.938585602894nam  2200349Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105024003100132043001200163050001100175049000900186100003800195245008800233264006500321264001000386300003400396336002600430337002600456338003600482504008300518520158600601588005702187610005202244650003702296650002802333655002202361710006502383856009602448on109947046720190429014927.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190429t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM7 a10.3998/mpub.100870162doi  an-us--- 4aKF8748  aEY2L1 aHitt, Matthew P.,d1985-eauthor.10aInconsistency and indecision in the United States Supreme Court /cMatthew P.

American law and society function more effectively when the Court resolves these ambiguous questions of Constitutional law. Since lower courts must defer to its reasoning, the Court should also promulgate clear and consistent legal doctrine, giving a reason for its judgment that a majority of justices support. Yet a Court that prioritizes resolving many disputes will at times produce contradictory sets of opinions or fail to provide a rationale and legal precedent for its decision at all. In either case, it produces an unreasoned judgment. Conversely, a Court that prioritizes logically consistent doctrine will fail to resolve many underlying disputes in law and society. Inconsistency and Indecision in the United States Supreme Court demonstrates that over time, institutional changes, lobbied for by the justices, substantially reduced unreasoned judgments in the Court's output, coinciding with a reduction in the Court's caseload. Hence, the Supreme Court historically emphasized the first goal of dispute resolution, but evolved into a Court that prioritizes the second goal of logically consistent doctrine. As a result, the Court today fails to resolve more underlying questions in law and society in order to minimize criticism of its output from other elites. In so doing, the modern Court often fails to live up to its Constitutional obligation.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aUnited States.bSupreme CourtxDecision making. 0aJudiical processzUnited States. 0aLawxPolitical aspects. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1008710602873nam  2200373Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003100132024003100163043001200194050001500206049000900221100003500230245006000265250002000325264006500345264001000410300004000420336002600460337002600486338003600512504008600548520150300634588005702137600003502194650004202229651004502271655002202316710006502338856009602403on109947046420190429014927.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190429t20192019miu      b    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  z9780472037599q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.114248942doi  af-rh--- 4aDT3000.M28  aEY2L1 aChan, Stephen,d1949-eauthor.10aMugabe :ba life of power and violence /cStephen Chan.  aSecond edition. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (xvii, 267 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographic essay by author (pages 243-253) and index (pages 254-267).3 aOn November 21, 2017, Robert Mugabe resigned as President of Zimbabwe after 37 years in power. A week earlier the military had seized control of the country and forced him to step down as leader of the ruling ZANU-PF party. In this revised and updated edition of his classic biography, Stephen Chan seeks to explain and interpret Mugabe in his role as a key player in the politics of Southern Africa. In this masterly portrait of one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, Mugabe's character unfolds with the ebb and flow of triumph and crisis. Mugabe's story is Zimbabwe's--from the post-independence hopes of idealism and reconciliation to electoral victory, the successful intervention in the international politics of Southern Africa, and the resistance to South Africa's policy of apartheid. But a darker picture emerged early with the savage crushing of the Matabeleland rising, the elimination of political opponents, growing corruption, and disastrous intervention in the Congo war, all worsened by drought and the HIV/AIDS crisis. Chan's highly revealing biography, based on close personal knowledge of Zimbabwe, depicts the emergence and eventual downfall of a ruthless and single-minded despot amassing and tightly clinging to political power. We follow as the triumphant nationalist leader who reconciled all in the new multiracial Zimbabwe degenerates into a petty tyrant consumed by hubris and self-righteousness and ultimately faces an ignominious endgame at the hands of his own army.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aMugabe, Robert Gabriel,d1924- 0aPrime ministerszZimbabwevBiography. 0aZimbabwexPolitics and governmenty1980- 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1142489402800nam  2200409Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020003100132020003100163020003800194024003000232043001200262050001300274100002700287245014800314264006500462264001000527300003400537336002600571337002600597338003600623490001900659504005700678520132300735588005702058650002502115650003102140650002102171655002202192700005002214710006502264830002002329856004102349on109969294220190502025508.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190502t20192019miu     ob    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  z9780472074280q(hardcover)  z9780472054282q(paperback)  z978-0472126088q(electronic book)7 a10.3998/mpub.92713562doi  aa-is--- 4aHV2078.51 aHammer, Gili,eauthor.10aBlindness through the looking glass :bthe performance of blindness, gender, and the sensory body /cGili Hammer ; foreword by Georgina Kleege. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4c√2019  a1 online resource (206 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aCorporealities  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 182-206).3 aModern Western culture is saturated with images, imprinting visual standards of concepts such as beauty and femininity onto our collective consciousness. Blindness Through the Looking Glass examines how gender and femininity are performed and experienced in everyday life by women who do not rely on sight as their dominant mode of perception, identifying the multiple senses involved in the formation of gender identity within social interactions. Challenging visuality as the dominant mode to understand gender, social performance, and visual culture, the book offers an ethnographic investigation of blindness (and sight) as a human condition, putting both blindness and vision "on display," discussing people's auditory, tactile, and olfactory experiences, as well as vision and sight, and exploring ways individuals perform blindness and "sightedness" in their everyday lives. Based on in-depth interviews with 40 blind women in Israel and anthropological fieldwork, the book investigates the social construction and daily experience of blindness in a range of domains. Uniquely, the book brings together blind symbolism with the everyday experiences of blind and sighted individuals, joining in mutual conversation the fields of disability studies, visual culture, anthropology of the senses, and gender studies.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aBlind womenzIsrael. 0aBlindnessxSocial aspects. 0aGender identity. 4aElectronic books.1 aKleege, Georgina,d1956-ewriter of foreword.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aCorporealities.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.927135604696nam  2200433Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040002700105020002900132020003500161020003200196024003100228050001500259245008700274264005400361264001000415300003500425336002600460337002600486338003600512490002100548520125800569504004101827505055301868505057802421505060402999505015903603588005703762600006003819655002203879700003703901700002703938710006503965776011404030830002204144856009604166on109969294320190502025508.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||190502t20192019miu      b    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  z9780472037414qpaperback  a9780472125296qelectronic book  a047212529Xqelectronic book7 a10.3998/mpub.101558142doi 4aPS3553.O5900aJane Cooper :ba radiance of attention /cMartha Collins and Celia Bland, editors. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2019. 4c√2019  a1 online resource (194 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aUnder discussion3 aFor her five volumes of poetry over the course of her career, Jane Cooper (1924-2007) was deeply admired by her contemporaries, and teaching at Sarah Lawrence College for nearly forty years, she served as a mentor to many aspiring poets. Her elegant, honest, and emotionally and formally precise poems, often addressing the challenges of women's lives--especially the lives of women in the arts--continue to resonate with a new generation of readers. Martha Collins and Celia Bland bring together several decades' worth of essential writing on Cooper's poetry. While some pieces offer close examination of Cooper's process or thoughtful consideration of the craft of a single poem, the volume also features reviews of her collections, including a previously unpublished piece on her first book, The Weather of Six Mornings (1969), by James Wright, a lifelong champion of her work. Marie Howe, Jan Heller Levi, and Thomas Lux, among others, share personal remembrances of Cooper as a teacher, colleague, and inspiration. L. R. Berger's moving tribute to Cooper's final days closes the volume. This book has much to offer for both readers who already love Cooper's work and new readers, especially among younger poets, just discovering her enduring poems.  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aIntro; Contents; Acknowledgments; Introduction / Celia Bland and Martha Collins; From the Open Sea: Body and Lyric in the Poetry of Jane Cooper / Kazim Ali; "Mercator's World": Jane Cooper's Early Work / Stephen Tapscott; Review of The Weather of Six Mornings / James Wright; The Weather of Six Mornings: Deference and Defiance in Jane Cooper's Debut / Ned Balbo; "Ablaze, Scared Child!" / Jan Heller Levi; The Story the Surface Cannot Say / Marie Howe; Jane Cooper: "The Builder of Houses" / Lee Upton; Jane Cooper's "Reclaimed" Poems / Eric Gudas8 a"In the Grip of a Difficult Century": Personal and Cultural History in Cooper's Maps & Windows / Clare RossiniMaps & Windows / Lee Briccetti; Endurance / Philip Levine; An Ecstasy of Space / Rachel Hadas; Dreamwords / Jean Valentine; The Fragile Human Settlement / Thomas Lux; "Threads: Rosa Luxemburg from Prison" / Lee Sharkey; Poets House Tribute to Jane Cooper / Galway Kinnell; Notes on Precision: Remembering Jane Cooper / Marilyn Chin; Inhabiting: Lessons from Jane Cooper's Spacious Architectures / Jenny Factor; Angle of Repose: Jane Cooper's Long View / Lisa Sack8 aJane Cooper and the Poetics of Sanity / Eve Grubin"The Green Notebook" / Gail Mazur; The Family Stories of Jane Cooper / Lynne Thompson; "I Could Not Tell You": Green Notebook, Winter Road and the Influence of Muriel Rukeyser / Lisa Sperber; Moving toward Connectedness: Jane Cooper's "The Infusion Room" / Maggie Anderson; Hospital Time: On Illness and Caregiving in Jane Cooper's "The Children's Ward" / Carley Moore; "Vocation: A Life" / Kevin Prufer and Patricia Yongue; Jane Cooper: Seventeen Names for Necessity / Beatrix Gates; Ordinary Details: Humor in the Work of Jane Cooper / Celia Bland8 aA Boat to See by, a Life to Row / Pamela AlexanderThe Flashboat: Poems Collected and Reclaimed / David Rigsbee; The Last Poem / L.

Yet children, presumed to exist outside the professional adult world, make their own contributions to it--creating and posting unboxing videos, for example, that provide content for toy marketers. Many adults, meanwhile, avidly consume entertainment products nominally meant for children. Media industries reincorporate this market-disrupting participation into their strategies, even turning to adult consumers to pass fandom to the next generation. Derek Johnson presents an innovative perspective that looks beyond the simple category of "kids' media" to consider how entertainment industry strategies invite producers and consumers alike to cross boundaries between adulthood and childhood, professional and amateur, new media and old. Revealing the social norms, reproductive ideals, and labor hierarchies on which such transformations depend, he identifies the lines of authority and power around which legacy media institutions like television, comics, and toys imagine their futures in a digital age. Johnson proposes that it is not strategies of media production, but of media reproduction, that are most essential in this context. To understand these critical intersections, he investigates transgenerational industry practice in television co-viewing, recruitment of adult comic readers as youth outreach ambassadors, media professionals' identification with childhood, the branded management of adult fans of LEGO, and the labor of child YouTube video creators. These dynamic relationships may appear to disrupt generational and industry boundaries alike. However, by considering who media industries empower when generating the future in these reproductive terms and who they leave out, Johnson ultimately demonstrates how their strategies reinforce existing power structures. This book makes vital contributions to media studies in its fresh approach to the intersections of adulthood and childhood, its attention to the relationship between legacy and digital media industries, and its advancement of dialogue between media production and consumption researchers. It will interest scholars in media industry studies and across media studies more broadly, with particular appeal to those concerned about the current and future reach of media industries into our lives.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aCultural industries. 0aMass media and children. 0aMass media. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9894091

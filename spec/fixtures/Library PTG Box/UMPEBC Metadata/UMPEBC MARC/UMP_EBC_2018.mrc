Ruins: Classical Theater and Broken Memory traces the remains, the remembering, and the forgetting of performance traditions of classical theater. The book argues that it is only when we look back over the accumulation of small evidence over a thousand-year sweep of classical theater that the remarkable and unequaled endurance of the tradition emerges. In the absence of more evidence, Odai Johnson turns instead to the absence itself, pressing its most legible gaps into a narrative about scars, vanishings, erasures, and silence: all the breakages that constitute the ruins of antiquity. In ten wide-ranging case studies, theater history and performance theory are brought together to examine the texts, artifacts, and icons left behind, reading them in fresh ways to offer an elegantly written, extended meditation on "how the aesthetic of ruins offered a model for an ideal that dislodged and ultimately stood in for the historic.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aTheaterzGreecexHistoryyTo 500. 0aTheaterzRomexHistoryyTo 500. 0aGreek dramaxHistory and criticism. 0aGreek literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aClassical dramaxHistory and criticism. 0aClassical literaturexHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body. 0aTheater--theory/text/performance.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.975107302986cam  2200361 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000150012902000300014402400300017404000270020404300120023105000100024310000340025324500730028726400640036030000220042433600260044633700260047233800360049850000200053452017240055458800570227865000260233565000220236165000460238365000200242965500220244971000610247185600920253220180904113558.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180215s2018    miu     o     001 0 eng    a9780472123629q(electronic book)  a0472123629  z9780472130757q(hardback)7 a10.3998/mpub.76418222doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  aa-cc-pe10aRJ2161 aGottschang, Suzanne,eauthor.10aFormulas for motherhood in a Chinese hospital /cSuzanne Gottschang. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2018.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.  aWhat happens to pregnant women when the largest country in the world implements a global health policy aimed at reorganizing hospitals and re- training health care workers to promote breastfeeding? Since 1992, the Chinese government has led the world in reorganizing more than 7,000 hospitals into "Baby- Friendly" hospitals. The initiative's goal, overseen by UNICEF and the World Health Organization, is to promote the practice of breastfeeding by reorganizing hospital routines, spaces, and knowledge in maternity wards and obstetrics clinics. At the same time, China's hospitals in the mid- 1990s operated as sites where the effects of economic reform and capitalism increasingly blurred the boundaries between state imperatives to produce healthy future citizens and the flexibility accorded individuals through their participation in an emerging consumer culture. Formulas for Motherhood follows a group of women over eighteen months as they visited a Beijing Baby- Friendly Hospital over the course of their pregnancies and throughout their postpartum recoveries. The book shows how the space of the hospital operates as a microcosm of the larger social, political, and economic forces that urban Chinese women navigate in the process of becoming a mother. Relations between biomedical practices, heightened expectations of femininity and sexuality demanded by a consumer culture, alongside international and national agendas to promote maternal and child health, reveal new agents of maternal governance emerging at the very moment China's economy heats up. This ethnography provides insight into how women's creative pragmatism in a rapidly changing society leads to their views and decisions about motherhood.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aBreastfeedingzChina. 0aLactationzChina. 0aMaternal health serviceszChinazBeijing. 2aBreast Feeding. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.764182203115nam a22004093i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702000290015602400300018504000270021504300120024205000270025410000400028124501170032124600550043826400640049330000420055733600260059933700260062533800360065149000200068750400670070752014160077458800570219065000490224765000380229665000550233465100540238965100520244365500220249571000760251783000200259385600920261320180830134532.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180824s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123704qelectronic book  z9780472053797qpaperback  z9780472073795qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.84323512doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU  an-us---00aHD5708.55.U6bL56 20181 aLinkon, Sherry Lee,d1959-eauthor.14aThe half-life of deindustrialization :bworking-class writing about economic restructuring /cSherry Lee Linkon.30aWorking-class writing about economic restructuring 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2018.  a1 online resource (xviii, 200 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aClass : culture  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 179-187) and index.3 a"Starting in the late 1970s, tens of thousands of American industrial workers lost jobs in factories and mines. Deindustrialization had dramatic effects on those workers and their communities, but its longterm effects continue to ripple through working-class culture. Economic restructuring changed the experience of work, disrupted people's sense of self, reshaped local landscapes, and redefined community identities and expectations. Through it all, working-class writers have told stories that reflect the importance of memory and the struggle to imagine a different future. These stories make clear that the social costs of deindustrialization affect not only those who lost their jobs but also their children, their communities, and American culture. Through analysis of poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, film, and drama, The Half-Life of Deindustrialization shows why people and communities cannot simply "get over" the losses of economic restructuring. The past provides inspiration and strength for working-class people, even as the contrast between past and present highlights what has been lost in the service economy. The memory of productive labor and stable, proud working-class communities shapes how people respond to contemporary economic, social, and political issues. These stories can help us understand the resentment, frustration, pride, and persistence of the American working class."  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aDeindustrializationzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aIndustrial policyzUnited States. 0aWorking classzUnited StatesxEconomic conditions. 0aUnited StatesxEconomic conditionsy20th century. 0aUnited StatesxSocial conditionsy20th century. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher. 0aClass, culture.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.843235102444cam  2200373 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000310016302000310019402000150022502400300024004000270027005000110029710000400030824500770034826400640042530000230048933600260051233700260053833800360056449000410060050400510064152010580069258800570175061000300180765000160183765500220185371000610187583000420193685600920197820180904112751.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180806s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123872q(electronic book)  a0472123874q(electronic book)  z9780472037308q(paperback)  z9780472130825q(hardcover)  z04720373077 a10.3998/mpub.87723232doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU 4aJK10251 aEvans, C.

In The Whips, C. Lawrence Evans offers a comprehensive exploration of coalition building and legislative strategy in the U.S. House and Senate, ranging from the relatively bipartisan, committee-dominated chambers of the 1950s to the highly polarized congresses of the 2000s. In addition to roll call votes and personal interviews with lawmakers and staff, Evans examines the personal papers of dozens of former leaders of the House and Senate, especially former whips. These records allowed Evans to create a database of nearly 1,500 internal leadership polls on hundreds of significant bills across five decades of recent congressional history. The result is a rich and sweeping understanding of congressional party leaders at work. Since the whips provide valuable political intelligence, they are essential to understanding how coalitions are forged and deals are made on Capitol Hill.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aUnited States.bCongress. 0aCoalitions. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aLegislative politics & policy making.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.877232302853nam a22003853i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000330016302000310019602400300022704000270025705000150028410000300029924501000032926400640042930000340049333600260052733700260055333800360057949000270061552011700064254201280181258800570194065000410199765000270203865000450206565500220211071000610213277001540219383000280234785600920237520180904101726.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180519s2018    miu     o     000 0 eng d  a9780472123926q(electronic book)  a0472123920q(electronic book)  a9780472900831q(open access)  z9780472130856q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.87847772doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU 4aZ701.3.D541 aBode, Katherine,eauthor.12aA world of fiction :bdigital collections and the future of literary history /cKatherine Bode. 1aAnn Arbor, Michiagn :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2018.  a1 online resource (261 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aDigital Humanities Ser  aDuring the 19th century, throughout the Anglophone world, most fiction was first published in periodicals. In Australia, newspapers were not only the main source of periodical fiction, but the main source of fiction in general. Because of their importance as fiction publishers, and because they provided Australian readers with access to stories from around the world-from Britain, America and Australia, as well as Austria, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, and beyond-Australian newspapers represent an important record of the transnational circulation and reception of fiction in this period. Investigating almost 10,000 works of fiction in the world's largest collection of mass-digitized historical newspapers (the National Library of Australia's Trove database), A World of Fiction reconceptualizes how fiction traveled globally, and was received and understood locally, in the 19th century. Katherine Bode's innovative approach to the new digital collections that are transforming research in the humanities are a model of how digital tools can transform how we understand digital collections and interpret literatures in the past.1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivativesuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aNewspapersxDigitizationzAustralia. 0aAustralian newspapers. 0aFictionxPublishingzAustraliaxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.1 iSupplement (work)aBode, KatherinetWorld of fiction : digital collections and the future of literary historyh1 online resource (research data sets) 0aDigital Humanities Ser.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.878477702582nam a22003733i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000310016302000150019402000300020902000150023902400300025404000270028405000270031110000290033824501070036726400640047430000230053833600260056133700260058733800360061350400510064952011480070058800570184865000440190565000480194965000360199765500220203371000610205585600920211620180904104051.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180517s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123933q(electronic book)  a0472123939q(electronic book)  z9780472053827q(paperback)  z0472053825  z9780472073825q(hardback)  z04720738267 a10.3998/mpub.92096522doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU 4aPN1590.A94bC37 2018eb1 aCarlson, Marla,eauthor.10aAffect, animals, and autists :bfeeling around the edges of the human in performance /cMarla Carlson. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2018.  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aWhen theater and related forms of live performance explore the borderlands labeled animal and autism, they both reflect and affect their audiences' understanding of what it means to be human. Affect, Animals, and Autists maps connections across performances that question the borders of the human whose neurodiverse experiences have been shaped by the diagnostic label of autism, and animal-human performance relationships that dispute and blur anthropocentric edges. By analyzing specific structures of affect with the vocabulary of emotions, Marla Carlson builds upon the conception of affect articulated by psychologist Silvan Tomkins. The book treats a diverse selection of live performance and archival video and analyzes the ways in which they affect their audiences. The range of performances includes commercially successful productions such as The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, War Horse, and The Lion King as well as to the more avant-garde and experimental theater created by Robert Wilson and Christopher Knowles, Back to Back Theatre, Elevator Repair Service, Pig Iron Theatre, and performance artist Deke Weaver.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAutistic people in the performing arts. 0aAffect (Psychology) in the performing arts. 0aAnimals in the performing arts. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.920965202916cam  2200409 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000310016302400300019404000270022404300120025105000240026310000440028724500970033124600550042826400640048326400100054730000400055733600260059733700260062333800360064949000520068550400510073752012140078858800570200265000250205965000600208465000650214465000690220965500220227871000610230083000530236185600920241420180904114344.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180424t20182018miua    ob   s001 0 eng    a9780472124039q(electronic book)  a047212403Xq(electronic book)  z9780472130900q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.98137892doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  aa-is---14aPN1059.T7bJ33 20181 aJacobs, Adriana Ximena,d1976-eauthor.10aStrange cocktail :btranslation and the making of modern Hebrew poetry /cAdriana X.

Through and in translation, poets have introduced new poetic styles, languages, and forms into their own writing, sometimes changing the course of literary history in the process. Strange Cocktail is the first comprehensive study of this phenomenon in modern Hebrew literature of the late nineteenth century to the present day. Its chapters on Esther Raab, Leah Goldberg, Avot Yeshurun, and Harold Schimmel offer close readings that examine the distinct poetics of translation that emerge from reciprocal practices of writing and translating. Working in a minor literary vernacular, the translation strategies that these poets employed allowed them to create and participate in transnational and multilingual poetic networks. Strange Cocktail thereby advances a comparative and multilingual reframing of modern Hebrew literature that considers how canons change and are undone when translation occupies a central position-how lines of influence and affiliation are redrawn and literary historiographies are revised when the work of translation occupies the same status as an original text, when translating and writing go hand in hand.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPoetryxTranslating. 0aPoetryxTranslating into HebrewxHistory and criticism. 0aTranslating and interpretingzIsraelxHistory and criticism. 0aHebrew poetryxTranslations into EnglishxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aMichigan studies in comparative Jewish cultures.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.981378902773nam  2200397 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000150012902000310014402400300017504000270020504300120023204900090024405000160025310000410026924000250031024501450033526400640048030000220054433600260056633700260059233800360061850000200065452012460067458800570192060000410197760000530201865000360207165000510210770000260215870000380218471000610222285600920228320180904115328.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180719s2018    miu     o    s001 0aeng    a9780472124060q(electronic book)  a0472124064  z9780472130917q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.92909532doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  an-us---  aEY2L10aPN2287.W4531 aWatkins, Harry,d1825-1894,eauthor.10aDiaries.kSelections12aA player and a gentleman :bthe diary of Harry Watkins, nineteenth-century US American actor /cedited by Amy E.

For fifteen years Watkins regularly recorded the plays he saw, the roles he performed, the books he read, and his impressions of current events. Performing across the U.S., Watkins collaborated with preeminent performers and producers, recording his successes and failures as well as his encounters with celebrities such as P. T. Barnum, Junius Brutus Booth, Edwin Forrest, Anna Cora Mowatt, and Lucy Stone. His is the only known diary of substantial length and scope written by a U.S. actor before the Civil War-making Watkins, essentially, the antebellum equivalent of Samuel Pepys. Theater historians Amy E. Hughes and Naomi J. Stubbs have selected, edited, and annotated excerpts from the diary in an edition that offers a vivid glimpse of how ordinary people like Watkins lived, loved, struggled, and triumphed during one of the most tumultuous periods in U.S. history. The selections in A Player and a Gentleman are drawn from a more expansive digital archive of the complete diary. The book, like its digital counterpart, will richly enhance our knowledge of antebellum theater culture and daily life in the U.S. during this period.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aWatkins, Harry,d1825-1894vDiaries.10aWatkins, Harry,d1825-1894tDiares.kSelections. 0aActorszUnited StatesvDiaries. 0aTheaterzUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century.1 aHughes, Amy,eeditor.1 aStubbs, Naomi J.,d1981-eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.929095302897nam a22004093i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000310016302400300019404000270022404300120025104900090026305000220027210000450029424500660033926400640040526400100046930000390047933600260051833700260054433800360057050400510060652012650065758800570192260000700197960000640204960000640211360000460217760000430222360000460226665500220231271000610233485600920239520180904100144.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180319t20182018miua    ob   s001 0 eng    a9780472124121q(electronic book)  a0472124129q(electronic book)  z9780472130931q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.97936962doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  ae-uk-en  aEY2L14aPR3106b.A53 20181 aAnderson, Emily Hodgson,d1977-eauthor.10aShakespeare and the legacy of loss /cEmily Hodgson Anderson. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2018. 4c√2018  a1 online resource (xiv, 228 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aHow do we recapture, or hold on to, the live performances we most love, and the talented artists and performers we most revere? Shakespeare and the Legacy of Loss tells the story of how 18th-century actors, novelists, and artists, key among them David Garrick, struggled with these questions through their reenactments of Shakespearean plays. For these artists, the resurgence of Shakespeare, a playwright whose works just decades earlier had nearly been erased, represented their own chance for eternal life. Despite the ephemeral nature of performance, Garrick and company would find a way to make Shakespeare, and through him the actor, rise again. In chapters featuring Othello, Richard III, Hamlet, The Winter's Tale, and The Merchant of Venice, Emily Hodgson Anderson illuminates how Garrick's performances of Shakespeare came to offer his contemporaries an alternative and even an antidote to the commemoration associated with the monument, the portrait, and the printed text. The first account to read 18th-century visual and textual references to Shakespeare alongside the performance history of his plays, this innovative study sheds new light on how we experience performance, and why we gravitate toward an art, and artists, we know will disappear.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aShakespeare, William,d1564-1616xStage historyzEnglandzLondon.10aShakespeare, William,d1564-1616xStage historyy1625-1800.10aShakespeare, William,d1564-1616xStage historyy1800-1950.10aGarrick, David,d1717-1779xPerformances.10aGarrick, David,d1717-1779xInfluence.10aSiddons, Sarah,d1755-1831xPerformances. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.979369602912cam  2200445 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000310016302400300019404000270022405000250025110000460027624501070032226400640042926400100049330000380050333600260054133700260056733800360059349000190062950400510064852011090069958800570180860000340186560000450189960000310194460000600197560000710203565000330210665000270213965000420216665000450220865500220225371000610227583000380233685600920237420180904111608.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180421t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng    a9780472124145q(electronic book)  a0472124145q(electronic book)  z9780472130955q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.99095382doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU14aP301.5.P67bC66 20181 aCondit, Celeste Michelle,d1956-eauthor.10aAngry public rhetorics :bglobal relations and emotion in the wake of 9/11 /cCeleste Michelle Condit. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2018. 4c√2018  a1 online resource (x, 338 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aConfigurations  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aIn Angry Public Rhetorics, Celeste Condit explores emotions as motivators and organizers of collective action-a theory that treats humans as "symbol-using animals" to understand the patterns of leadership in global affairs-to account for the way in which anger produced similar rhetorics in three ideologically diverse voices surrounding 9/11: Osama bin Laden, President George W. Bush, and Susan Sontag. These voices show that anger is more effective for producing some collective actions, such as rallying supporters, reifying existing worldviews, motivating attack, enforcing shared norms, or threatening from positions of power; and less effective for others, like broadening thought, attracting new allies, adjudicating justice across cultural norms, or threatening from positions of weakness. Because social anger requires shared norms, collectivized anger cannot serve social justice. In order for anger to be a force for global justice, the world's peoples must develop shared norms to direct discussion of international relations. Angry Public Rhetorics provides guidance for such public forums.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aBin Laden, Osama,d1957-2011.10aBush, George W.q(George Walker),d1946-10aSontag, Susan,d1933-2004.17aBin Laden, Osama,d1957-2011.2fast0(OCoLC)fst0176133217aBush, George W.q(George Walker),d1946-2fast0(OCoLC)fst00363849 0aRhetoricxPolitical aspects. 0aAngerxSocial aspects. 0aSeptember 11 Terrorist Attacks, 2001. 0aInternational relationsxSocial aspects. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aConfigurations (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.990953802935cam  2200397 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000150012902000300014402400300017404000270020404300120023105000140024310000290025724501050028626400640039130000220045533600260047733700260050333800360052950400510056552014020061658800570201861000460207565000440212165000650216565100430223065100300227365000300230365000290233365500220236271000610238485600920244520180904113721.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180619s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng    a9780472124282q(electronic book)  a0472124285  z9780472131006q(hardback)7 a10.3998/mpub.99463952doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  aa-tu---10aDR435.K871 aGurses, Mehmet,eauthor.10aAnatomy of a civil war :bsociopolitical impacts of the Kurdish conflict in Turkey /cMehmet Gurses. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2018.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aAnatomy of a Civil War demonstrates the destructive nature of war, ranging from the physical to the psychosocial, as well as war's detrimental effects on the environment. Despite such horrific aspects, evidence suggests that civil war is likely to generate multilayered outcomes. To examine the transformative aspects of civil war, Mehmet Gurses draws on an original survey conducted in Turkey, where a Kurdish armed group, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), has been waging an intermittent insurgency for Kurdish self-rule since 1984. Findings from a probability sample of 2,100 individuals randomly selected from three major Kurdish-populated provinces in the eastern part of Turkey, coupled with insights from face-to-face in-depth interviews with dozens of individuals affected by violence, provide evidence for the multifaceted nature of exposure to violence during civil war. Just as the destructive nature of war manifests itself in various forms and shapes, wartime experiences can engender positive attitudes toward women, create a culture of political activism, and develop secular values at the individual level. In addition, wartime experiences seem to robustly predict greater support for political activism. Nonetheless, changes in gender relations and the rise of a secular political culture appear to be primarily shaped by wartime experiences interacting with insurgent ideology.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.20aPartiya KarkereÃÇn KurdistaneÃÇxHistory. 0aKurdszTurkeyxPolitics and government. 0aKurdszTurkeyxHistoryxAutonomy and independence movements. 0aTurkeyxPolitics and governmenty1980- 0aTurkeyxEthnic relations. 0aInsurgencyvCase studies. 0aCivil warvCase studies. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.994639502836cam  2200421 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000330016302000310019602000310022702400300025804000270028805000090031510000300032424501140035426400640046830000230053233600260055533700260058133800360060749000350064350400510067852010640072953600630179354201280185658800570198465000340204165000340207565000320210965000260214165500220216771000610218977000720225085600920232220180904113246.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180704s2018    miu     ob   s001 0 eng    a9780472124343q(electronic book)  a047212434Xq(electronic book)  a9780472900862q(open access)  z9780472074037q(hardcover)  z9780462054039q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.99523772doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU10aP3061 aGonzales, Laura,eauthor.10aSites of translation :bwhat multilinguals can teach us about digital writing and rhetoric /cLaura Gonzales. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2018.  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aDigital Rhetoric Collaborative  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aWinner of the 2016 Sweetland Digital Rhetoric Collaborative Book Prize.

Blending ethnographic and empirical methods from multiple disciplines, Laura Gonzales provides methodological examples of how linguistic diversity can be studied in practice, both in and outside the classroom, and provides insights into the rhetorical labor that is often unacknowledged and made invisible in multilingual communication. Sites of Translation is relevant to researchers and teachers of writing as well as technology designers interested in creating systems, pedagogies, and platforms that will be more accessible and useful to multilingual audiences. Gonzales presents multilingual communication as intellectual labor that should be further valued in both academic and professional spaces, and supported by multilingual technologies and pedagogies that center the expertise of linguistically diverse communicators.  aSponsored by the Sweetland Digital Rhetoric Collaborative.1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivativesuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aTranslating and interpreting. 0aTranslanguaging (Linguistics) 0aMultilingual communication. 0aLanguage and culture. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.1 iSupplement:aBloom, Gina,tSites of translationh2 bilingual videos40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.995237702449cam  2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000150012902000300014402000310017402400310020504000270023604900090026305000110027224501230028326400640040630000230047033600260049333700260051933800360054550400510058152009920063258800570162465000410168165000320172265000200175465500220177470000420179670000350183870000360187371000610190985600930197020180917092040.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180728s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng    a9780472123766q(electronic book)  a0472123769  z9780472131105q(hardback)  z9780472037155q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.100172002doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  aEY2L10aJZ130500aConstructivism reconsidered :bpast, present, and future /cMariano E.

Constructivism Reconsidered explores Constructivism's theoretical, empirical, and methodological strengths and weaknesses, and debates what these say about its past, present, and future to reach a better understanding of IR in general and how Constructivism informs IR in particular.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aInternational relationsxPhilosophy. 0aConstructivism (Philosophy) 0aConstructivism. 4aElectronic books.1 aBertucci, Mariano E.,d1975-eeditor.1 aHayes, Jarrod,d1978-eeditor.1 aJames, Patrick,d1957-eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1001720002241nam a2200325 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000310012902000310016002400300019104000270022104900090024824500740025724600290033126400640036030000220042433600260044633700260047233800360049852010430053458800570157765100390163460000330167365500220170670000340172871000610176285600920182320180917092352.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180911s2018    miu           000 0 eng d  a9780472124152q(electronic book)  z9780472073962q(hardcover)  z9780472053964q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.97094262doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  aEY2L00aCultures of Yusin :bSouth Korea in the 1970s /cYoungju Ryu, Editor.30aSouth Korea in the 1970s 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2018.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aCultures of Yusin examines the turbulent and yet deeply formative years of Park Chung Hee's rule in South Korea, focusing on the so-called Yusin era (1972-79). Beginning with the constitutional change that granted dictatorial powers to the president and ending with his assassination, Yusin was a period of extreme political repression coupled with widespread mobilization of the citizenry towards the statist gospel of modernization and development. While much has been written about the political and economic contours of this period, the rich complexity of its cultural production remains obscure. This edited volume brings together a wide range of scholars to explore literature, film, television, performance, music, and architecture, as well as practices of urban and financial planning, consumption, and homeownership. Examining the plural forms of culture's relationship to state power, the authors illuminate the decade of the 1970s in South Korea and offer an essential framework for understanding contemporary Korean society.¬†  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aKorea (South)xHistoryy1960-1988.10aPark, Chung Hee,d1917-1979. 4aElectronic books.1 aRyu, Youngju,d1974-eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.970942603943nam  22004093i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000150012702000290014202000290017102400300020004000270023004900090025705000240026610000360029024501030032624600500042926400550047926400150053430000350054933600260058433700260061033800360063649000250067250400510069750505460074852018330129458800570312765000580318465000580324265500220330071000610332283000580338385600920344120180823100132.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||171106s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng    a9780472123360qelectronic book  a047212336X  z9780472053681qpaperback  z9780472073689qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.97245782doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  aEY2L14aPL8010.6b.M85 20180 aMuÃÉkoma wa NguÃÉgiÃÉ,eauthor.14aThe rise of the African novel :bpolitics of language, identity, and ownership /cMukoma Wa Ngugi.30aPolitics of language, identity, and ownership 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c{copy}2018  a1 online resource (221 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aAfrican perspectives  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aIntroduction.

Jordan's Child of two worlds to Noviolet Bulawayo's fractured multiple worlds -- Manufacturing the African literary canon : costs and opportunities -- Toward a rooted transnational African literature : politics of image and naming.  aThe Rise of the African Novel is the first book to situate South African and African-language literature of the late 1880s through the early 1940s in relation to the literature of decolonization that spanned the 1950s through the 1980s, and the contemporary generation of established and emerging continental and diaspora African writers of international renown. Calling it a major crisis in African literary criticism, Mukoma Wa Ngugi considers key questions around the misreading of African literature: Why did Chinua Achebe's generation privilege African literature in English despite the early South African example? What are the costs of locating the start of Africa's literary tradition in the wrong literary and historical period? What does it mean for the current generation of writers and scholars of African literature not to have an imaginative consciousness of their literary past? While acknowledging the importance of Achebe's generation in the African literary tradition, Mukoma Wa Ngugi challenges that narrowing of the identities and languages of the African novel and writer. In restoring the missing foundational literary period to the African literary tradition, he shows how early South African literature, in both aesthetics and politics, is in conversation with the literature of the African independence era and contemporary rooted transnational literatures. This book will become a foundational text in African literary studies, as it raises questions about the very nature of African literature and criticism. It will be essential reading for scholars of African literary studies as well as general readers seeking a greater understanding of African literary history and the ways in which critical consensus can be manufactured and rewarded at the expense of a larger and historical literary tradition.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAfrican fictiony19th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aAfrican fictiony20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aAfrican perspectives (University of Michigan.

Between the 1970s and the 2000s, during times of peace and prosperity, affluent countries-like Belgium, Greece, Italy, and Japan-accumulated so much debt that they became vulnerable and exposed themselves to the risk of default. In the past three decades, an extensive scholarly consensus emerged that these problems were created by fiscal indiscipline, the lack of sufficient concern for budgetary constraints from policy makers as they try to please voters. This approach formed the foundation for the fiscal surveillance system that attempted to bring borrowing in European countries under control via a set of fiscal rules.

Economies of manhood.  aWriting during the reign of emperors Trajan and Hadrian, Juvenal drew on Roman legend and the history of preceding imperial dynasties as a means of scrutinizing cultural upheavals in the Rome of his day. Tacky foreigners, the nouveaux riches, women who don't know their place, bloodthirsty--even crazy--emperors and their (often worse) wives confront the reader at every turn, along with bad poets, corrupt aristocrats, gladiators, whores, false philosophers, sad-sack men in the street, and slaves. Juvenal's poetry set the tone, and often the topics, for satirists throughout the centuries of European literature. In his sixteen verse satires, Juvenal presents speakers who decry the breakdown in traditional Roman values and the status of Roman men as they are confronted by upstart foreigners, devious and deviant women, class traitors, the power of the imperial household, and even the body itself. The satirist castigates vice and immorality even as he revels in describing them. This book locates Juvenal's targets among the matrices of birth, wealth, class, gender, and ethnicity and walks carefully through a number of his most arresting vignettes in order to show not only what, but how, he satirizes. Moreover, the analysis shows that Juvenal's portraits sometimes escape his grasp, and, as often as not, he ends up undermining the voice with which he speaks and the values he claims to hold dear. Individual chapters look at the satirist himself, rebellious bodies, disgraced aristocrats, uppity (even murderous) wives, and the necessary but corrupting power of money. The conclusion considers the endurance of both the targets and the rhetoric behind them in the modern world. Making Men Ridiculous will interest scholars and advanced students of ancient satire, later European satire, imperial Roman culture and literature, and class, gender, and sexuality in the ancient world.00aJuvenalxCriticism and interpretation. 0aMasculinity in literature. 0aAnxiety in literature. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.977915002875nam  22004093i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000150012702000290014202000150017102400300018604000270021605000240024324501440026724600460041126400550045726400100051230000390052233600260056133700260058733800360061349000170064950400510066652013180071758800570203565000420209265000210213465500220215570000620217770000260223970000290226571000610229483000180235585600920237320180823100509.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170927s2018    miua    ob    001 0 eng    a9780472123513qelectronic book  a0472123513  z9780472130672qhardcover  z04721306767 a10.3998/mpub.97558132doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU14aML3470b.P6615 201804aThe pop palimpsest :bintertextuality in recorded popular music /cLori Burns and Serge Lacasse, editors ; foreword by J.

After brutal state police beatings stunned the nation on "Bloody Sunday," troops under federal court order lined the route as the march finally made its way to the State Capitol and a triumphant address by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. But within hours klan terror struck, claiming the life of one of the marchers, Viola Liuzzo, a Detroit mother of five. Turner offers an insider's view of the three trials that took place over the following nine months--which finally resulted in the conviction of the killers. Despite eyewitness testimony by an FBI informant who was riding in the car with the killers, two all-white state juries refused to convict. It took a team of Civil Rights Division lawyers, led by the legendary John Doar, to produce the landmark jury verdict that klansmen were no longer above the law. This is must reading today, as the voting rights won in Selma come under renewed attack.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aLiuzzo, Viola,d1925-1965.20aSelma to Montgomery Rights Marchd(1965 :cSelma, Ala.) 0aCivil rights movementszSouthern StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aTrials (Murder)zAlabama. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.1 iSupplement (work):aTurner, James P.,tSelma and the Liuzzo murder trials.h1 online resource (Court documents, court transcripts, exhibits, and memoranda.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.975337304451nam a22003973i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000320012702000290015902400300018804000270021805000140024524501330025926400880039226400100048030000620049033600260055233700260057833800360060452013380064050515240197850400510350258800570355360000600361060000510367065000270372165000370374865000240378565500220380970000370383170000320386871000610390085600920396120180821163811.0m     o  d        cr cn|||||||||171221s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng    a9780472123568qelectronic book  a0472123564qelectronic book  z9780472037087qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.80571392doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU10aPS2954.U600aUncle Tom's cabins :bthe transnational history of America's most mutable book /cedited by Tracy C.

For over 150 years it has been coopted for a dazzling array of causes far from what its author envisioned. This book tells thirteen variants of Uncle Tom's journey, explicating the novel's significance for Canadian abolitionists and the Liberian political elite that constituted the runaway characters' landing points; nineteenth-century French theatergoers; liberal Cuban, Romanian, and Spanish intellectuals and social reformers; Dutch colonizers and Filipino nationalists in Southeast Asia; Eastern European Cold War communists; Muslim readers and spectators in the Middle East; Brazilian television audiences; and twentieth-century German holidaymakers. Throughout these encounters, Stowe's story of American slavery serves as a paradigm for understanding oppression, selectively and strategically refracting the African American slave onto other iconic victims and freedom fighters. The book brings together performance historians, literary critics, and media theorists to demonstrate how the myriad cultural and political effects of Stowe's enduring story has transformed it into a global metanarrative with national, regional, and local specificity"--cProvided by publisher.0 aIntroduction / Tracy C.

What are the political and ethical implications of trust? Drawing from a wide range of disciplines, Trust and Hedging in International Relations adds to the emerging literature on trust in international relations by offering a systematic measure of state-to-state trust. Looking at how relationships between European microstates and their partners have evolved over the past few centuries, Stiles finds that rather than trusting, most microstates are careful to hedge in their relations by agreeing only to arrangements that provide them with opt-out clauses, heavy involvement in joint decision-making, and sunset provisions. In the process, Stiles assesses the role of rationality, social relations, identity politics, and other theories of trust to demonstrate that trust is neither essential for cooperation nor a guarantee of protection and safety. Finally, he explores the ethical implications of a foreign policy founded on trust--in particular whether heads of state have the right to enter into open-ended agreements that put their citizens at risk"--cProvided by publisher.0 aTrust in international relations? -- Luxembourg : the dangers of trust -- Liechtenstein : the virtue of hedging -- San Marino : the virtue of trust -- Monaco : the limits of hedging -- Andorra : eking out autonomy -- Trust from dominance -- Conclusion.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aInternational relationsxSocial aspectsvCase studies. 0aStates, SmallvCase studies. 0aTrustxPolitical aspectsvCase studies. 0aLuxembourgxForeign relations. 0aLiechtensteinxForeign relations. 0aSan MarinoxForeign relations. 0aMonacoxForeign relations. 0aAndorraxForeign relations. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.975085205670nam a22004453i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000350010702000320014202000290017402000290020302400300023204000270026204300120028905000250030124500840032624600340041026400880044426400100053230000380054233600260058033700260060633800360063249000390066850400510070752016070075852013860236558800570375150505610380850505330436965000510490265000260495365500220497970000300500171000610503183000400509285600920513220180821163608.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180208s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng    a2018006204  a9780472123605qelectronic book  a0472123602qelectronic book  z9780472073771qhardcover  z9780472053773qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.92739382doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  aa-kr---14aBJ1500.T73bT73 201800aTransgression in Korea :bbeyond resistance and control /cJuhn Y.

Following the serial killings of Korea's raincoat killer, the events that led to the dissolution of the United Progressive Party, the criminal negligence of the owner and also the crew members of the sunken Sewol Ferry, as well as the political scandals of 2016, there has been much public debate about morality, transparency, and the law in South Korea. Yet, despite its prevalence in public discourse, transgression in Korea has not received proper scholarly attention. Transgression in Korea challenges the popular conceptions of transgression as resistance to authority, the collapse of morality, and an attempt at self- empowerment. Examples of transgression from premodern, modern, and contemporary Korea are examined side by side to underscore the possibility of reading transgression in more ways than one. These examples are taken from a devotional screen from medieval Korea, trickster tales from the late Choson period, reports about flesh eating humans, newspaper articles about same- sex relationships from colonial Korea, and films about extramarital affairs, wayward youths, and a vengeful vigilante. Bringing together specialists from various disciplines such as history, art history, anthropology, premodern literature, religion, and film studies, the context- sensitive readings of transgression provided in this book suggest that transgression and authority can be seen as forming something other than an antagonistic relationship"--cProvided by publisher.  a"As the nine chapters that comprise the present volume will try to show, transgression has been feared, disavowed, regulated, interrogated, and enjoyed to fashion and often exploit various sorts of subjectivities in Korea. The boundaries and thresholds that were either erased or respected to make these subjectivities possible, however, were not incommensurate with the instrumental aims of the established socio-political system as assumed by Han. Cannibalism is a good example. As demonstrated in one of the chapters of this book, during the ChosoÃÜn dynasty (1392-1910) cannibalism posed a serious conundrum for a state that sought to find stability and order in the Confucian vision of a well-structured, deferential, and hierarchical society. The state knew that it could encourage the populace to cultivate the Confucian virtue of filial piety by taking advantage of the numerous stories of exemplary men and women sacrificing parts of their bodies to feed their ill parents, but it also knew that malicious rumors of humans eating other humans (as medicine and sustenance) had the potential to threaten the stability of the established social order. In the eyes of the state the human body could be consumed if it was sacrifice but not if it was flesh. The state accordingly made serious effort to ensure that the body consumed remained sacrifice"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.0 aIntro -- Contents -- Acknowledgments -- Introduction -- Juhn Y.

Guarini's madrigals provide insight into northern Italian court culture of the late Renaissance, when poetry and music were enjoyed as companion arts. Hundreds of composers of Guarini's day set his lyric poems to music. Primarily known today in their vocal settings, most famously those of Claudio Monteverdi, the poems merit appreciation in their own right. This volume is organized into ten sections, grouping the madrigals around themes such as the anguish of passion, the asymmetry of desire, the incursions of jealousy, and the possibility of mutual bliss. Nicholas R. Jones renders Guarini's poetry into accessible contemporary English verse that nevertheless stays true to the substance and form of the original texts, reflecting their roots in the Petrarchan poetic tradition and displaying the emotion and musicality that made these lyrics so popular from the start. A substantive introduction provides cultural context for the madrigals and their musical settings; brief commentaries follow each translation to illuminate aspects of poetic and rhetorical craft. An extensive appendix lists the madrigal compositions that set these lyrics for vocal performance. The book fills a major gap in the scholarship on Guarini's literary legacy. It will appeal to scholars of literature, Renaissance studies, and musicology, early-music performers, and general readers interested in poetry and classical music. Nicholas R. Jones is Professor Emeritus of English, Oberlin College. Also an amateur musician, Jones engages in historically informed performance practice with early music ensembles in the San Francisco Bay Area.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aGuarini, Battista,d1538-1612xCriticism and interpretation. 0aMadrigals, Italian. 0aMadrigals, ItalianxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.1 aJones, Nicholas R.,d1946-etranslator.12aGuarini, Battista,d1538-1612.tPoems.kSelections.lEnglish.12aGuarini, Battista,d1538-1612.tPoems.kSelections.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.969605003464cam  2200457 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000350010702000150014202000290015702000150018602000290020102000150023002400300024504000270027504300120030205000250031410000430033924500850038226400550046726400100052230000380053233600260057033700260059633800360062250400510065858800570070952009710076650505740173750503190231165000600263065000600269065000430275065000290279365000210282265500220284371000490286585600920291420180803082606.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180424s2018    miu     ob   s001 0 eng    a2018019965  a9780472123636qelectronic book  a0472123637  z9780472130740qhardcover  z0472037099  z9780472037094qpaperback  z04721307497 a10.3998/mpub.97807112doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  an-us---14aNX180.S6bH3185 20181 aHarding, James Martin,d1958-eauthor.10aPerformance, transparency, and the cultures of surveillance /cJames M.

This exploration draws upon a rich array of examples from theatre, performance, and the arts, all of which provide vivid illustration of the book's central argument: that the rise of the surveillance society coincides with a profound collapse of democratic oversight and transparency--a collapse that, in turn, demands a radical rethinking of how performance practitioners conceptualize art and its political efficacy. The book thus makes the case that artists and critics must reexamine--indeed, must radically redefine--their notions of performance if they are to mount any meaningful counter to the increasingly invasive surveillance society.0 aIntro -- Contents -- Introduction.

During World War I, a motley group of teenaged amateurs, impoverished war refugees, and out- of- work Russian actors banded together to revolutionize the Yiddish stage. Achieving a most unlikely success through their productions, the Vilna Troupe (1915-36) would eventually go on to earn the attention of theatergoers around the world. Advancements in modern transportation allowed Yiddish theater artists to reach global audiences, traversing not only cities and districts but also countries and continents. The Vilna Troupe routinely performed in major venues that had never before allowed Jews, let alone Yiddish, upon their stages, and operated across a vast territory, a strategy that enabled them to attract unusually diverse audiences to the Yiddish stage and a precursor to the organizational structures and travel patterns that we see now in contemporary theater. Debra Caplan's history of the Troupe is rigorously researched, employing primary and secondary sources in multiple languages, and is engagingly written.  aDescription based on information provided by publisher20aVÃ£ilner trupe. 0aTraveling theaterxHistoryy20th century. 0aTheater, YiddishxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.1 iSupplement (work):aCaplan, Debra.h1 online resource (2 audio files, 3 video files, 35 digital images)tYiddish Empire.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.953332003089cam  2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000150012702000290014202400300017104000270020104300120022805000090024010000290024924501290027824600380040726400550044526400100050030000340051033600260054433700260057033800360059650400510063250504990068352011580118258800570234065000480239765000510244565500220249670000440251871000490256285600920261120180802144921.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180409s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123728qelectronic book  a0472123726  z9780472037148qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.98363212doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  an-us--- 4aE1601 aSax, Joseph L.,eauthor.10aMountains without handrails :breflections on the National Parks /cby Joseph L.

Sax's thought-provoking treatise on America's national parks, remains as relevant today as when first published in 1980. Focusing on the long-standing and bitter battles over recreational use of our parklands, Sax proposes a novel scheme for the protection and management of America's national parks. Drawing upon still controversial disputes-Yosemite National Park, the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, and the Disney plan for California's Mineral King Valley-Sax boldly unites the rich and diverse tradition of nature writing into a coherent thesis that speaks directly to the dilemma of the parks. In a new foreword, environmental law scholar Holly Doremus articulates this book's enduring importance and reflects on what Sax, her former teacher, might have thought about the encroachment of technology into natural spaces, the impact of social media, and growing threats from climate change. At this moment of great uncertainty for the national parks, Mountains Without Handrails should be read (and re-read) by anyone with a stake in America's natural spaces.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aNational parks and reserveszUnited States. 0aPublic landsxRecreational usezUnited States. 4aElectronic books.1 aDoremus, Holly D.,eauthor of foreword.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.983632103161nam a22005053i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000320012702000290015902400300018804000270021804300120024505000240025710000310028124500950031224600500040726400650045726400110052230000350053333600260056833700260059433800360062049000610065652009490071750400260166650400510169250501850174358800570192865000600198565000610204565000260210665000310213265000630216365000530222665000310227965000360231065000360234665000360238265500220241871000610244083000620250185600920256320180803081408.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180130s2018    miua    obq  s001 0 eng    a9780472123834qelectronic book  a0472123831qelectronic book  z9780472130801qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.94868892doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  ae-gx---14aPT149.B55bL39 20181 aLayne, Priscilla,eauthor.10aWhite rebels in Black :bGerman appropriation of Black popular culture /cPriscilla Layne.30aGerman appropriation of Black popular culture 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018.  a1 online resource (270 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aSocial History, Popular Culture, and Politics in Germany  a"Analyzing literary texts and films, White Rebels in Black shows how German authors have since the 1950s appropriated black popular culture, particularly music, to distance themselves from the legacy of Nazi Germany, authoritarianism, and racism, and how such appropriation changes over time. Priscilla Layne offers a critique of how blackness came to symbolize a positive escape from the hegemonic masculinity of postwar Germany, and how black identities have been represented as separate from, and in opposition to, German identity, foreclosing the possibility of being both black and German. Citing four autobiographies published by black German authors Hans JuÃàrgen Massaquo, Theodor Michael, GuÃànter Kaufmann, and Charly Graf, Layne considers how black German men have related to hegemonic masculinity since Nazi Germany, and concludes with a discussion on the work of black German poet, Philipp Khabo KoÃàpsell."--Provided by publisher.  aIncludes filmography.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aWho's afraid of the black cook? -- Waiting for my band -- The blues and blue jeans : American dreams in the East -- Two black boys look at the white boy -- The future is unwritten.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aGerman literaturey20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aGerman literaturexBlack authorsxHistory and criticism. 0aBlacks in literature. 0aMasculinity in literature. 0aBlacks in popular culturezGermanyxHistoryy20th century. 0aMotion pictureszGermanyxHistoryy20th century. 0aBlacks in motion pictures. 0aMasculinity in motion pictures. 0aBlackszRace identityzGermany. 0aWhiteszRace identityzGermany. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.948688903780nam a22004213i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000320012702000250015902000220018402400300020604000270023605000290026310000330029224000240032524500400034926400650038926400100045430000600046433600260052433700260055033800360057649000200061250400410063250508330067352014850150658800570299165000130304865000240306165000330308565000440311865500220316271000610318483000210324585600920326620180823095758.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180209t20182018miua    ob    000 0 eng d  a9780472123841qelectronic book  a047212384Xqelectronic book  z9780472037209qpaper  z047203720Xqpaper7 a10.3998/mpub.98780462doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU 4aPS3603.A77425bA6 2018eb1 aCarr, Julie,d1966-eauthor.10aEssays.kSelections10aSomeone shot my book /cJulie Carr. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (194 pages) :billustrations (color).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aPoets on poetry  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aSomeone shot my book -- The witch's house : a poetics -- By beauty and by fear : on narrative time -- Spirit ditties of no tone : on listening -- The poet scholar -- I believe that we will win -- Another note on violence -- In defense of my experiences, or, the body and the avant-garde -- No video : on Anne Carson -- Muse X : on Lyn Hejinian's Oxota : a short Russian novel -- Latin for female wanderer : on Lisa Robertson -- On saying no : Valentine and Dickinson break the glass -- Women and war, love, labor : the legacy of Lorine Niedecker -- Ralph Lemon, Fred Moten, and the unspeakable : an improvisatory line -- On property and monstrosity -- Interview with Rob Mclennan for Touch the donkey supplement #7 : seven questions for Julie Carr, June 2014 -- Interview with Sofi Thanhauser for Entropy magazine, June 7, 2016.  aApproaching the practices of reading and writing from a feminist perspective, Julie Carr asks vital ethical questions about the role of poetry--and of art in general--in a violent culture. She addresses issues such as the art of listening, the body and the avant-garde, gun violence, police brutality, reading and protest, and feminist responses to war in essays that are lucid, inventive, and informed by a life lived with poetry. Essays on poets Lorine Niedecker, Jean Valentine, Anne Carson, Lyn Hejinian, and Lisa Robertson detail some of the political, emotional, and spiritual work of these forerunners. A former dancer, Carr also takes up question of text, dance, performance, and race in an essay on the work of choreographer, writer, and visual artist Ralph Lemon and poet Fred Moten. Carr's essays push past familiar boundaries between the personal/confessional and experimental/conceptual strains in American poetry. Pressing philosophical inquiries into the nature of gender, motherhood, fear, the body, and violence up against readings of twentieth- and twenty-first-century poets, she asks us to consider the political and affective work of poetry in a range of contexts. Carr reports on her own practices, examining her concerns for research and narrative against her investment in lyric, as well as her history as a dancer and her work as curator and publisher. Carr's breadth of inquiry moves well beyond the page, yet remains grounded in languages possibilities.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPoetics. 0aPoetryxAuthorship. 0aFeminist literary criticism. 0aAmerican poetryxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aPoets on poetry.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.987804603244nam a22004213i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000310009202000280012302000290015102000260018002000350020602400300024104000270027104300210029805000280031910000260034724501000037324600460047326400650051926400100058430000340059433600260062833700260065433800360068050400510071652015470076753600370231454201650235158800570251663000320257365000210260565000210262665500220264771000610266985600920273020180810083010.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180406s2018    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a9780472900855qopen access  a0472900854qopen access  z9780472130634qhardcover  z0472130633qhardcover  z9780472123452qelectronic book7 a10.3998/mpub.97172842doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  aa-cc---aa-kr--- 4aGR335.4.L53bC46 2018eb1 aCho, Sookja,eauthor.10aTransforming gender and emotion :bthe Butterfly Lovers story in China and Korea /cSookja Cho.30aButterfly Lovers story in China and Korea 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (294 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aThe Butterfly Lovers Story, sometimes called the Chinese Romeo and¬†Juliet, has been enduringly popular in China and Korea. In Transforming Gender and Emotion, Sookja Cho demonstrates why the Butterfly Lovers Story is more than just a popular love story. By unveiling the complexity of themes and messages concealed beneath the tale's modern classification as a tragic love story, this book reveals the tale as a rich academic subject for students of human emotions and relationships, comparative geography and culture, and narrative adaptation. By examining folk beliefs and ideas that abound in the narrative-including rebirth and a second life, the association of human souls and butterflies, and women's spiritual power-this book presents the Butterfly Lovers Story as an example of local religious narrative. The book's cross-cultural comparisons, best manifested in its discussion of a shamanic ritual narrative version from the Cheju Island of Korea, frame the story as a catalyst for inclusive,¬† expansive discussion of premodern Korean and Chinese literatures and cultures. This scrutiny of the historical and cultural background behind the formation and popularization of the Cheju Island version sheds light on important issues in the Butterfly Lovers Story that are not frequently discussed-either in past examinations of this particular narrative or in the overall literary studies of China and Korea. This new, open approach presents an innovative framework for understanding premodern literary and cultural space in East Asia.  aSponsored by Knowledge Unlatched  fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 Unported licenseuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher.00aLiang Shanbo yu Zhu Yingtai 0aFolklorezChina. 0aFolklorezKorea. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.971728403890nam a22004573i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000290009202000290012102400300015004000270018004100130020704300120022005000220023210000620025424000310031624501280034726400650047526400100054030000410055033600260059133700260061733800360064349000360067952019220071552000780263754600590271558800570277460000730283160000740290465000290297865000290300765000590303665000500309565500220314570000600316771000760322783000370330385600920334020180830124133.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180824t20182018miu     ob    001 0 lat d  z9780472053841qpaperback  z9780472073849qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.96989092doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU0 alatbeng  aa-ii---00aPA2095b.J33 20180 aJacobus,cde Voragine,dapproximately 1229-1298,eauthor.10aLegenda aurea.kSelections10aReading medieval Latin with the legend of Barlaam and Josaphat /c[edited and supplied with commentary by] Donka D.

Markus offers comprehensive commentary on the 13th-century Dominican theologian Jacobus de Voragine's retelling of the ancient story of the life of the Buddha that will resonate with contemporary students of Latin. Jacobus's version of the legend serves as a compelling, original Latin text. Vividly conveyed through parables, fables, and anecdotes, it naturally lends itself to a critical consideration of ethical principles and philosophical truths commonly shared across many cultures. With its rich stylistic devices and authentic classical Latin word order, it provides superb training for reading rhetorical prose before advancing to the works of more complex classical prose authors. At the same time, the text offers a unique opportunity for systematically learning the special features of Late and Medieval Latin. Included in this volume are two presentations of Jacobus's text: one maintaining the original orthography reflecting Latin as it appears in medieval manuscripts, and one in which the orthography follows Classical Latin norms. This textbook is designed for intermediate-level learners of Classical or Medieval Latin, whether in college, high school, or by self-directed study. The 5,000-word narrative text lends itself to a semester-long experience of reading one continuous work of prose. Each of the legend's embedded stories can also be read as an independent selection with the help of the ample commentary, vocabulary, and grammar guidance. The extensive introduction provides the necessary background to contextualize the legend in its Latin iteration and sufficient historical information to make the reading meaningful for those without prior knowledge of Buddhism or medieval history. Additionally, this work makes Latin attractive to students of diverse backgrounds, as it highlights the language's important8 arole in disseminating the universally shared cultural legacy of humanity.  aIn Latin, with introduction and commentary in English.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.00aBarlaam,cSaint (Legendary character)vLegendsvEarly works to 1800.00aJosaphat,cSaint (Legendary character)vLegendsvEarly works to 1800. 0aLatin languagevReaders. 0aLatin languagexGrammar. 0aChristian saintszIndiavLegendsvEarly works to 1800. 0aMartyrszIndiavLegendsvEarly works to 1800. 4aElectronic books.1 aMarkus, Donka D.,eeditor,ewriter of added commentary.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher. 0aMichigan classical commentaries.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.969890902789nam a22003973i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000370010702000150014402000310015902000310019002400300022104000270025105000100027810000380028824500870032626400650041330000230047833600260050133700260052733800360055349000370058950400510062652013170067758800570199465000330205165000320208465000410211665000210215765500220217871000610220083000380226185600920229920180904093239.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||171120s2017    miu     ob    001 0 eng    a2017056052  a9780472123544q(electronic book)  a0472123548  z9780472073757q(hardcover)  z9780472053759q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.87654182doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU00aP94.61 aAlvarez, Natalie,d1974-eauthor.10aImmersions in cultural difference :btourism, war, performance /cNatalie Alvarez. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018]  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aTheater: theory/text/performance  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aIn a time of intensifying xenophobia and anti-immigration measures, this book examines the impulse to acquire a deeper understanding of cultural others. Immersions in Cultural Difference takes readers into the heart of immersive simulations, including a simulated terrorist training camp in Utah; mock Afghan villages at military bases in Canada and the UK; a fictional Mexico-US border run in Hidalgo, Mexico; and an immersive tour for settlers at a First Nations reserve in Manitoba, Canada. Natalie Alvarez positions the phenomenon of immersive simulations within intersecting cultural formations: a neoliberal capitalist interest in the so-called "experience economy" that operates alongside histories of colonization and a heightened state of xenophobia produced by War on Terror discourse. The author queries the ethical stakes of these encounters, including her own in relation to the field research she undertakes. As the book moves from site to site, the reader discovers how these immersions function as intercultural rehearsal theaters that serve a diverse set of strategies and pedagogical purposes: they become a "force multiplier" within military strategy, a transgressive form of dark tourism, an activist strategy, and a global, profit-generating practice for a neoliberal capitalist marketplace.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aIntercultural communication. 0aCross-cultural orientation. 0aInternational relations and culture. 0aPerforming arts. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aTheater--text/theory/performance.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.876541803359cam  2200373 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000310016302400300019404000270022404100130025105000230026410000320028724000370031924501110035626400650046730000390053233600260057133700260059733800360062349000520065950400510071152018770076258800570263965000230269665500220271970000380274171000610277983000530284085600920289320180904112722.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||171120s2018    miua    ob    001 0 eng    a9780472123551q(electronic book)  a0472123556q(electronic book)  z9780472130689q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.93945292doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU1 aenghger14aCD995b.F7513 20181 aFriedrich, Markus,eauthor.14aDie Geburt des Archivs.lEnglish14aThe birth of the archive :ba history of knowledge /cMarkus Friedrich ; translated by John NoeÃàl Dillon. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018]  a1 online resource (ix, 284 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCultures of knowledge in the early modern world  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aThe Birth of the Archive traces the history of archives from their emergence in the Late Middle Ages through the Early Modern Period, and vividly shows how archives permeated and fundamentally changed European culture. Archives were compiled and maintained by peasants and kings, merchants and churchmen, and conceptions of archives were as diverse as those who used them. The complex, demanding job of the archivist was just as variable: archivists might serve as custodians, record-keepers, librarians, legal experts, historians, scholars, researchers, public officials, or some combination thereof; navigating archives was often far from straightforward. The shift of archival storage from haphazard collections of papers to the methodically organized institutionalized holdings of the nineteenth century was a gradual, nonlinear process. Friedrich provides an essential background to the history of archives over the centuries and enriches the story of their evolution with chapters on key sociocultural aspects of European archival culture. He discusses their meaning and symbolism in European thought, early modern conceptions of the archive's function, and questions of access and usability. Exploring the close, often vexed relationship between archives and political power, Friedrich illustrates the vulnerability of archives to political upheaval and war. He concludes with an introspective look at how historians used their knowledge of and work with archives to create distinct representations of themselves and their craft. The Birth of the Archive engages with scholarship in political history, the history of mentalities, conceptions of space, historiography, and the history of everyday life in early modern Europe. It has much to offer for specialists and scholars, while the jargon-free prose of this translation is also accessible to the general reader.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aArchivesxHistory. 4aElectronic books.1 aDillon, John NoeÃàl,etranslator.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aCultures of knowledge in the early modern world.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.939452902509nam a22003493i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000310016302000310019402400300022504000270025504900090028205000270029110000310031824500700034926400650041930000380048433600260052233700260054833800360057450400510061052012140066158800570187565000300193265000220196265500220198471000610200685600920206720180904112359.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180404s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng    a9780472123582q(electronic book)  a0472123580q(electronic book)  z9780472073764q(hardcover)  z9780472053766q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.97513012doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  aEY2L14aPN1995.9.C34bC66 20181 aCook, Amy,d1970-eauthor.10aBuilding character :bthe art and science of casting /cAmy Cook. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018]  a1 online resource (vi, 188 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aWhat can we learn about how we understand each other and ourselves by examining the casting we find on stage and film-the casting we find perfect and the casting we find wrong? Building Character examines how the process of "casting" an actor in a part creates a character and how this can be usefully understood through deploying theories from the cognitive sciences. A casting director may match the perceived qualities of an actor with the perceived qualities of the character, but the combination is also synergistic; casting a character creates qualities. While casting directors do this professionally, all of us do this when we make sense of the people around us. This book argues that we build the characters of others from a sea of stimuli and that the process of watching actors take on roles improves our ability to "cast" those roles in our daily lives. Amy Cook examines the visible celebrity casting, such as Robert Downey Jr. as Ironman or Judi Dench as Bond's M, the political casting of one candidate as "presidential" and another as "weak," the miscasting of racial profiling and sexual assault, and the counter casting that results when actors and characters are not where or who we expect.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aMotion picturesxCasting. 0aTheaterxCasting. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.975130102864nam a22003733i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400300015604000270018605000260021310000340023924501100027326400650038326400100044830000810045833600260053933700260056533800360059149000500062750400510067752013440072858800570207265000260212965000270215565000380218265500220222070000380224271000760228083000420235685600920239820180830134021.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180824t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123599qelectronic book  a9780472130719qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.97185952doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aHQ1391.U5bL39 2018eb1 aLazarus, Jeffrey V.,eauthor.10aGendered vulnerability :bhow women work harder to stay in office /cJeffrey Lazarus and Amy Steigerwalt. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (ix, 226 pages) :b32 tables, 28 charts, 1 B&W photograph.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aLegislative politics and policy making series  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aGendered Vulnerability examines the factors that make women politicians more electorally vulnerable than their male counterparts. For instance, female candidates get less and lower quality coverage from the media; they face more and better quality political opponents; and they receive less support from their political parties. Beyond these purely electoral factors, women face persistent gender biases throughout society, which makes it more difficult for them to succeed and can also lead them to doubt their abilities and qualifications. These factors combine to convince women that they must work harder to win elections-a phenomenon that Jeffrey Lazarus and Amy Steigerwalt term "gendered vulnerability." Since women feel constant pressure to make sure they can win reelection, they devote more of their time and energy to winning their constituents' favor. For example, women secure more federal spending for their districts and states than men do; women devote more time and energy to constituent services; women introduce more bills and resolutions; and women's policy positions are more responsive to what their voters want. Lazarus and Steigerwalt examine a dozen different facets of legislative behavior, and find that across them all, female members simply do a better job of representing their constituents than male members.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aWomen in public life. 0aWomen public officers. 0aSex discrimination against women. 4aElectronic books.1 aSteigerwalt, Amy,d1976-eauthor.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher. 0aLegislative politics & policy making.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.971859503612nam a22004813i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000450012702000290017202400300020104000270023104300300025805000240028810000320031224501030034426400650044726400100051230000550052233600260057733700260060333800360062950400510066550504620071652012770117858800530245565000260250865000440253465000450257865000400262365000550266365000430271865000340276165000330279565000300282865000440285865000290290265000210293165500220295271000640297485600920303820180830145305.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180827t20182018miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123643qelectronic book  z9780472037100qpaperbackqalkaline paper  z9780472130733qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.87735402doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU  aa-kr---aa------aa-ja---10aD810.C698bS66 20181 aSon, Elizabeth W.,eauthor.10aEmbodied reckonings :b"comfort women," performance, and transpacific redress /cElizabeth W.

Until the End -- Notes -- Bibliography -- Index3 aEmbodied Reckonings examines the political and cultural aspects of contemporary performances that have grappled with the history of the "comfort women," the Japanese military's euphemism for the sexual enslavement of girls and young women-mostly Korean-in the years before and during World War II. Long silent, in the early 1990s these women and their supporters initiated varied performance practices-protests, tribunals, theater, and memorial-building projects-to demand justice for those affected by state-sponsored acts of violence. The book provides a critical framework for understanding how actions designed to bring about redress can move from the political and legal aspects of this concept to its cultural and social possibilities. Based on extensive archival and ethnographic research, the study argues for the central role of performance in how Korean survivors, activists, and artists have redressed the histories-and erasures-of this sexual violence. Merging cultural studies and performance theory with a transnational, feminist analysis, the book illuminates the actions of ordinary people, thus offering ways of reconceptualizing legal and political understandings of redress that tend to concentrate on institutionalized forms of state-based remediation.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aComfort womenzKorea. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xAtrocitieszAsia. 0aService, Compulsory non-militaryzJapan. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xWomenzKorea. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945vPersonal narratives, Korean. 0aReparations for historical injustices. 0aWomenxCrimes againstzKorea. 0aSexual abuse victimszKorea. 0aCollective memoryzKorea. 0aPerformance artxSocial aspectszKorea. 0aArtsxPolitical aspects. 0aFeminismzKorea. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.877354003299nam a22003493i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400300015604000270018604300120021305000150022510000560024024501030029626400650039926400100046430000540047433600260052833700260055433800360058050400510061650506570066750500940132452012510141858800530266965000370272265500220275971000760278185600920285720180830140337.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180827t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123650qelectronic book  z9780472037117qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.97427002doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU  an-us-mi00aQK525.5.M51 aPalmer, Daniel D.q(Daniel Dooley),d1930-eauthor.10aMichigan ferns and lycophytes :ba guide to species of the Great Lakes region /cDaniel D.

The species in these groups exhibit incredibly diverse life cycles and an amazing array of morphology. Some species such as the Bracken fern are widespread and aggressive, dominating forest understories throughout much of northern Michigan, while other species are exceedingly rare and adapted to life solely in harsh niche habitats where little else can grow. Unlike the well-studied flowering plants and gymnosperms, Michigan's ferns and lycophytes have long lacked a reliable, up-to-date guidebook, and this book fills that gap. Covering all 120 taxa found in the state, it features detailed keys, species descriptions, and range maps alongside precise illustrations. Readers learn about the etymology of species' common and scientific names as well as interesting facts about their historic uses by humans and place within the Michigan ecosystem. The book also provides information on the challenging taxonomy of many ferns and lycophytes, with special attention given to the species likely to hybridize and those prone to misidentification. This is a must-have reference for anyone who wishes to learn about these important components of the Great Lakes flora."  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aFernszMichiganzIdentification. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.974270003415nam a22003493i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000470012702400300017404000270020405000140023110000340024524500970027924600430037626400650041926400100048430000520049433600260054633700260057233800360059850400510063452018300068552002340251558800530274960000660280260000190286865500220288771000640290985600920297320180830141318.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180827t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123667qelectronic book  z9780472130764qhardcover ;qalkaline paper7 a10.3998/mpub.87693992doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU10aPA3874.A51 aSchironi, Francesca,eauthor.14aThe best of the grammarians :bAristarchus of Samothrace on the Iliad /cFrancesca Schironi.30aAristarchus of Samothrace on the Iliad 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (1016 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aA founding father of the "art of philology," Aristarchus of Samothrace (216-144 BCE) developed a sound, almost scientific method of literary exegesis, making a profound contribution to ancient scholarship. In his work on the text of Homer's Iliad, his methods and principles inevitably informed, even reshaped, his edition of the epic. The Best of the Grammarians, a systematic study of the most famous grammarian in Alexandria, places Aristarchus and his Iliadic scholia, or marginal annotations, within the context and cultural environment of his own time. Francesca Schironi presents a more robust picture of Aristarchus as a scholar than anyone has offered previously. Based on her analysis of over 4,300 fragments of his scholia, she reconstructs Aristarchus' methodology and its relationship to earlier scholarship, and especially to Aristotle, as well as the cultural milieu in which he was immersed. In doing so, Schironi departs from the standard commentary on individual fragments, and instead offers a broad yet rigorously scholarly examination of how Aristarchus worked. Combining the accuracy and detail of old-school philological works on individual fragments with a big-picture study enabling the identification of recurrent patterns and methodological trends across Aristarchus' work, this volume represents a new approach to scholarship in Alexandrian and classical philology. It will be the go-to reference book on this topic for many years to come, and will usher in a new way of addressing the highly technical work of ancient scholars without losing philological accuracy, shifting the focus from details of individual fragments to the broader picture of how ancient scholars approached literary texts, what drove their methodology, and what contribution their work provided to those who came after them.8 aThis book will be valuable to classicists and philologists interested in scholarship on Aristarchus, Homer and Homeric criticism in antiquity, the history of Greek culture, Hellenistic scholarship, and ancient literary criticism.  aDescription based on information from publisher.00aAristarchus,cof Samothrace,dapproximately 217 B.C.-145 B.C.00aHomer.tIliad. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.876939903117nam a22004093i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000470012702400300017404000270020404300210023105000200025210000410027224500940031326400650040726400100047230000390048233600260052133700260054733800360057349000610060950400510067050504940072152009510121558800570216665000460222365000710226965000310234065000310237165000530240265500220245571000760247783000620255385600920261520180830124849.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180824t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123735qelectronic book  z9780472130788qhardcover ;qalkaline paper7 a10.3998/mpub.97719902doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU  ae-gx---ae------14aPT91b.K66 20181 aKontje, Todd Curtis,d1954-eauthor.10aImperial fictions :bGerman literature before and beyond the nation-state /cTodd Kontje. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (xi, 329 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aIntroduction -- National origins and the imperial past -- German literary history and the medieval renaissance -- Silesian patriots and imperial subjects -- Goethe and the end of the Holy Roman Empire -- Romantic nationalism and imperial nostalgia -- Worldly provincialism in imperial Germany -- Collapsing empires and nascent nations -- Revisiting the Heimat after the Third Reich -- Popular fiction and the imperial past -- Conclusion : national literature in an era of world literature.3 aImperial Fictions explores ways in which writers from late antiquity to the present have imagined communities before and beyond the nation-state. It takes as its point of departure challenges to the discrete nation-state posed by globalization, migration, and European integration today, but then circles back to the beginnings of European history after the fall of the Roman Empire. Unlike nationalist literary historians of the nineteenth century, who sought the tribal roots of an allegedly homogeneous people, this study finds a distant mirror of analogous processes today in the fluid mixtures and movements of peoples. Imperial Fictions argues that it is time to stop thinking about today's multicultural present as a deviation from a culturally monolithic past. We should rather consider the various permutations of "German" identities that have been negotiated within local and imperial contexts from the early Middle Ages to the present.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aGerman literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aGerman literaturezEurope, German-speakingxHistory and criticism. 0aImperialism in literature. 0aNationalism in literature. 0aNational characteristics, German, in literature. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher. 0aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.977199002626nam a22003853i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000310016302400300019404000270022404300120025105000220026310000310028524500740031626400650039030000230045533600260047833700260050433800360053049000430056650400510060952011290066058800570178961000530184661000410189965000550194065500220199570000280201771000610204583000420210685600920214820180904105539.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180116s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng    a9780472123759q(electronic book)  a0472123750q(electronic book)  z9780472130795q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.92357282doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  an-us---14aJK1021b.C37 20181 aCarson, Jamie L.,eauthor.10aElectoral incentives in Congress /cJamie L.

Mayhew contends that once in office, legislators pursue the actions that put them in the best position for reelection. The electoral connection is a post-World War II phenomenon, but legislative scholars now suggest that Mayhew's argument applies to earlier congressional eras. To assess these claims, Carson and Sievert investigate whether earlier legislators were motivated by the same factors that influence their behavior today, especially in pursuit of reelection. They examine how electoral incentives shape legislative behavior throughout the nineteenth century by looking at patterns of turnover in Congress; the re-nomination of candidates; the roles of parties in recruiting candidates, and by extension their broader effects on candidate competition; and, finally by examining legislators' accountability. The results have wide-ranging implications for the evolution of Congress and the development of various legislative institutions over time.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aUnited States.bCongressxHistoryy19th century.10aUnited States.bCongressxElections. 0aLegislatorszUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 4aElectronic books.1 aSievert, Joel,eauthor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aLegislative politics & policy making.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.923572803658nam a22003613i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000470012702000440017402400300021804000270024805000260027510000370030124500680033826400650040626400150047130000350048633600260052133700260054733800360057349000200060950400410062950511580067052011870182858800570301565000130307265500220308571000760310783000210318385600920320420180830132928.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180824t20182018miu     ob    000 | eng d  a9780472123827qelectronic book  z9780472037193qpaperback ;qalkaline paper  z0472037196qpaperback ;qalkaline paper7 a10.3998/mpub.98679242doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU00aPS3561.E3387bA6 20181 aKeelan, Claudia,d1959-eauthor.10aEcstatic eÃÅmigreÃÅ :ban ethics of practice /cClaudia Keelan. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c{copy}2018  a1 online resource (168 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aPoets on poetry  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 tPrologue: reading and writing spiritual utility --tPreliminaries --tApology --tA concrete memoir --tFrom Without sovereignty --t"It might have begun differently" --tRevising the parade : against the poetry of witness --tReclaiming paradise --tA hinge-history : Robinson Jeffers and Brenda Hillman --tA garden is a frame structure --tFrom Erasing names, multiplying alliances (Salt Lake City via Memphis via Las Vegas) --tSnow in America (Boston) --tNearing cradle --tNative stranger --tLessons of the whirlwind --tThe citizen stranger : an ethics of definition --tThe instant --tInterview for The Range of the Possible, conducted by Tod Marshall (The Secularist and Utopic) --tInterview for Barrow Street, conducted by Derek Pollard (Utopic and The Devotion Field) --tThe poet on the poem : For My Lost Original : Elegy Is a Seeking in "Everybody's Autobiography" (Missing Her) --tInterview for Omnidawn Press, conducted by Rusty Morrison (Truth of My Songs : Poems of the Trobairitz) --tPoetics statement for Poetry Society of America, "In their own words" (O, Heart) --tInterview with Thomas Barkman for Barrow Street (O, Heart).3 a"Most think of an eÃÅmigreÃÅ as one who leaves her native land to find home in another.

Mapping her own peripatetic evolution in poetry and her nomadic life, she also engages with Christian and Buddhist doctrines on the virtues of dispossession. Ecstatic EÃÅmigreÃÅ pays homage to poets from Thoreau and Whitman to Alice Notley, all of whom share a commitment to living and writing in the moment. Keelan asks the same questions about the growth of flowers or the meaning of bioluminescence as she does about the poetics of John Cage or George Oppen. Her originality is grounded by the ways in which she connects poetic principles with the spiritual concepts of via negativa demonstrated both in St. John of the Cross and Mahayana Buddhism. In addition, her essays demonstrate an activist spirit and share a commitment to the passive resistance demonstrated in Martin Luther King, Jr.'s concept of the "beloved community" and philosopher Simone Weil's dedication to "exile.""  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPoetics. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher. 0aPoets on poetry.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.986792403360nam a22003733i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000310016302000150019402400300020904000270023904300120026604900090027805000250028710000360031224000230034824500510037126400650042226400100048730000230049733600260052033700260054633800360057252019100060852001920251858800570271065000440276765500220281171000610283385600920289420180904101049.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180508s2018    miu     ob   s000 0 eng d  a9780472123858q(electronic book)  a0472123858q(electronic book)  z9780472130818q(hardcover)  z04721308117 a10.3998/mpub.97646392doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  an-us-mi  aEY2L 4aGV584.M5bB34 2018eb1 aBacon, John U.,d1964-eauthor.10aWorks.kSelections10aBest of Bacon :bselect cuts /cJohn U.

They cover a dozen different sports for a dozen different media outlets, from the Ann Arbor News to National Public Radio, and they stretch from a couple pages to a dozen. But they have one thing in common: they all meant a lot to me when I wrote them, and they still do today." The Best of Bacon presents both new and familiar stories by best-selling author John U. Bacon, all centered on sports in his home state of Michigan. Best known for his acclaimed books on college football, Bacon's writing has been praised for going beyond traditional Xs and Os sports reporting. True to that reputation, this collection showcases personal, behind-the-scenes stories of players, coaches, and even fans. Many of these stories are connected to specific moments in time-a great season, the passing of a legendary broadcaster, or a star player's daily grind before a big game-and will immediately transport readers to some of the highs (and lows) of their own sports memories. More often, Bacon's writing explores timeless themes-why we love sports, how we pass that passion down to the next generation, and how it will be threatened or preserved in the future. ‚ÄãMichigan is one of the nation's best sports states, home to countless amateur squads, two Big Ten schools, and professional teams in all four major sports whose histories reach back to the start of their leagues-something only New York, Massachusetts, and Illinois can also claim. This book covers the spectrum, from insider profiles of big names like Magic Johnson, Bo Schembechler, and Joe Louis, to cautionary tales of the debilitating greed threatening our favorite pastimes, to uplifting stories of the unsung heroes whose passion drives them to coach Little League baseball teams or run summer camps for peanuts. These stories speak to the value of sports, but also to our values.  aWhether a Spartan or a Wolverine, a long-suffering Lions' backer or a diehard Wing-Nut, a lifetime sports fan or just someone who loves a good story, there is something here for everyone.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aSportszMichiganxHistoryvMiscellanea. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.976463903080nam a22003613i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000450012702400300017204000270020204300120022905000240024110000480026524500820031326400650039526400100046030000370047033600260050733700260053333800360055950400510059550504770064652012290112358800570235265000300240965100470243965100420248665500220252871000760255085600920262620180830135055.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180824t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123889qelectronic book  z9780472130832qhardcoverqalkaline paper7 a10.3998/mpub.88771432doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU  aa-ko---14aHF2370.5b.K75 20181 aKrieckhaus, Jonathan Tabor,d1967-eauthor.10aGeopolitical economy :bthe South Korean FTA strategy /cJonathan Krieckhaus. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (x, 182 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aAbbreviations -- Acknowledgments -- Perspectives -- Introduction -- Geopolitical economy -- FTAS, statistics, and Korea -- Containment and South Korean development -- The Korean FTA strategy -- FTAs as development strategy -- FTA consequences -- The geopolitics of FTAs -- South Korea and the United States -- China, the European Union, and Japan -- The emerging geopolitical economy -- Appendix: documentation of chapter 3 and chapter 5 -- Notes -- Bibliography -- Index.3 aGeopolitical Economy examines the significance and nature of free trade agreements (FTAs), the primary policy tool through which modern nations seek access to international markets and promote economic growth. The book focuses specifically on how South Korea, the world's leader in the number and significance of FTAs as well as the world's sixth largest export economy, uses FTAs. Jonathan Krieckhaus argues that geopolitics-the struggle between powerful nations over specific geographic regions around the globe-influenced FTA strategy and economic policy in South Korea and beyond. This perspective illustrates the security approach to FTAs, but adds that the geographic specificity of security concerns deeply shape FTA policy. Geopolitical Economy also looks at Korean FTAs through the lens of development strategy. South Korea is singularly successful in garnering FTAs with all three players in the global economy: the United States, the European Union, and China. This unprecedented success was built on a strong commitment from three consecutive Korean presidential administrations, each operating within a favorable state-society context that enjoyed the existence of a centralized and effective trade bureaucracy.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aFree tradezKorea (South) 0aKorea (South)xForeign economic relations. 0aKorea (South)xEconomic policyy2002- 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.887714303219nam a22003733i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000470012702400300017404000270020404300120023105000230024310000290026624501420029526400650043726400150050230000570051733600260057433700260060033800360062650400510066250503970071352012980111058800570240865100280246565000410249365000300253465500220256470000910258671000760267785600920275320180830134236.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180824t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123896qelectronic book  z9780472130849qhardcover ;qalkaline paper7 a10.3998/mpub.97363762doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU  as-bl---00aF1463.2b.L45 20181 aLehmann, David,eauthor.14aThe prism of race :bthe politics and ideology of affirmative action in Brazil /cDavid Lehmann ; foreword by Antonio Sergio GuimaraÃÉes. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c{copy}2018  a1 online resource (xxii, 247 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aAfter Durban : affirmative action goes to university -- Classification wars : a Brazilian dispute -- Race, class, and education in the search for social justice -- The quotas campaign as a social movement -- The campaign and theories of social movements -- Selected indicators on the growth of the Brazilian higher education system (2003-2014) -- Interviews carried out between 2008 and 2014.3 a"Brazil has developed a distinctive response to the injustices inflicted by the country's race relations regime. Despite the mixed racial background of most Brazilians, the state recognizes people's racial classification according to a simple official scheme in which those self-assigned as black, together with "brown" and "indigenous" (preto-pardo-indigena), can qualify for specially allocated resources, most controversially quota places at public universities. Although this quota system has been somewhat successful, many other issues that disproportionately affect the country's black population remain unresolved, and systemic policies to reduce structural inequality remain off the agenda. In The Prism of Race, David Lehmann explores, theoretically and practically, issues of race, the state, social movements, and civil society, and then goes beyond these themes to ask whether Brazilian politics will forever circumvent the severe problems facing the society by co-optation and by tinkering with unjust structures. Lehmann disrupts the paradigm of current scholarly thought on Brazil, placing affirmative action disputes in their political and class context, bringing back the concept of state corporatism, and questioning the strength and independence of Brazilian civil society."  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aBrazilxRace relations. 0aAffirmative action programszBrazil. 0aMulticulturalismzBrazil. 4aElectronic books.1 aGuimaraÃÉes, AntoÃÇnio SeÃÅrgio A.q(AntoÃÇnio SeÃÅrgio Alfredo),ewriter of foreword.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.973637603206nam a22004453i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000370016302000340020002000330023402000310026702000310029802400300032904000270035904300120038605000240039805000280042210000260045024500970047626400650057330000400063833600260067833700260070433800360073049000370076650400510080352013700085453600660222454201280229058800570241865000350247565000370251065500220254771000610256983000380263085600920266820180904101310.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180616s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123919q(electronic book)  a0472123912q(electronic book)  a9780472901081q(electronic book)  a0472901087q(electronic book)  a9780472901081q(open access)  z9780472073818q(hardcover)  z9780472053810q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.98311182doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  ae-uk--- 4aPN2589b.B56 2018eb 4aPN2590.G36bB564 2018eb1 aBloom, Gina,eauthor.10aGaming the stage :bplayable media and the rise of English commercial theater /cGina Bloom. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018]  a1 online resource (xii, 276 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aTheater: Theory/Text/Performance  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aRich connections between gaming and theater stretch back to the 16th and 17th centuries, when England's first commercial theaters appeared right next door to gaming houses and blood-sport arenas. In the first book-length exploration of gaming in the early modern period, Gina Bloom shows that theaters succeeded in London's new entertainment marketplace largely because watching a play and playing a game were similar experiences. Audiences did not just see a play; they were encouraged to play the play, and knowledge of gaming helped them become better theatergoers. Examining dramas written for these theaters alongside evidence of analog games popular then and today, Bloom argues for games as theatrical media and theater as an interactive gaming technology. Gaming the Stage also introduces a new archive for game studies: scenes of onstage gaming, which appear at climactic moments in dramatic literature. Bloom reveals plays to be systems of information for theater spectators: games of withholding, divulging, speculating, and wagering on knowledge. Her book breaks new ground through examinations of plays such as The Tempest, Arden of Faversham, A Woman Killed with Kindness, and A Game at Chess; the histories of familiar games such as cards, backgammon, and chess; less familiar ones, like Game of the Goose; and even a mixed-reality theater videogame.  aSponsored by University of California, Davis, TOME initiative1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivativesuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aGameszGreat BritainxHistory. 0aTheaterzGreat BritainxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aTheater--theory/text/performance.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.983111803474nam a22003973i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000470012702000290017402400300020304000270023305000280026010000330028824501540032124600940047526400650056930000590063433600260069333700260071933800360074549000410078150400510082250506830087352010150155658800570257161000510262861000730267965100550275265500220280770000370282971000760286683000420294285600920298420180904124246.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180824t20182018miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123957qelectronic book  z9780472073832qhardcover ;qalkaline paper  z9780472053834qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.89185882doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU14aJK1059 111thb.M37 20181 aMarshall, Bryan W.,eauthor.14aThe committee :ba study of policy, power, politics, and Obama's historic legislative agenda on Capitol Hill /cBryan W.

Henry A. Waxman (D-CA), chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce-one of the most powerful committees in Congress-Bruce C. Wolpe kept a diary, a senior staffer's look at how committees develop and promote legislation. With its insider's view of the rough-and-tumble politics of cap-and-trade, healthcare reform, tobacco, oversight, and the debt ceiling agreement, The Committee uniquely melds the art of politics and policymaking with the theory and literature of political science. The authors engage with the important questions that political science asks about committee power, partisanship, and the strategies used to build winning policy coalitions both in the Committee and on the floor of the House. The insider politics and strategies about moving legislation in Congress, from internal and external coalition building to a chairman's role in framing policy narratives, will captivate both novice and die-hard readers of politics.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aUnited States.bCongressn(111th :d2009-2010)10aUnited States.bCongress.bHouse.bCommittee on Energy and Commerce. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty2009-2017. 4aElectronic books.1 aWolpe, Bruce C.,d1951-eauthor.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher. 0aLegislative politics & policy making.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.891858802516nam a22003493i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000310016302000310019402400300022504000270025505000250028210000390030724500860034626400650043230000340049733600260053133700260055733800360058350000200061952011870063958800570182665000320188365000440191565000320195965500220199171000610201385600920207420180904100600.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180208s2018    miu     o    s001 0 eng    a9780472123964q(electronic book)  a0472123963q(electronic book)  z9780472073856q(hardcover)  z9780472053858q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.98707612doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU 4aPN1590.T43bA87 20181 aAuslander, Philip,d1956-eauthor.10aReactivations :bessays on performance and its documentation /cPhilip Auslander. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018]  a1 online resource (137 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.  aMost people agree that witnessing a live performance is not the same as seeing it on screen; however, most of the performances we experience are in recorded forms. Some aver that the recorded form of a performance necessarily distorts it or betrays it, focusing on the relationship between the original event and its recorded versions. By contrast, Reactivations focuses on how the audience experiences the performance, as opposed to its documentation. How does a spectator access and experience a performance from its documentation? What is the value of performance documentation? The book treats performance documentation as a specific discursive use of media that arose in the middle of the 20th century alongside such forms of performance as the Happening and that is different, both discursively and as a practice, from traditional theater and dance photography. Philip Auslander explores the phenomenal relationship between the spectator who experiences the performance from the document and the document itself. The document is not merely a secondary iteration of the original event but a vehicle that gives us meaningful access to the performance itself as an artistic work.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPerforming artsxTechnique. 0aPerforming artsxInformation resources. 0aPerforming artsxAudiences. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.987076106264nam a22005053i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000470012702400300017404000270020404300210023105000250025224501980027726400650047526400100054030000520055033600260060233700260062833800360065449000340069050400510072450505450077550505700132050505320189050505480242250505530297052014110352354600260493458800530496061000650501365000630507865000540514165000670519565100400526265500220530270000630532470000550538771000740544271000650551671000640558183000210564585600920566620180830151729.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180828t20182018miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123971qelectronic book  z9780472130870qhardcover ;qalkaline paper7 a10.3998/mpub.95197452doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU  af-ua---an-us-mi14aPA3315.K37bP37 201800aPapyri from Karanis :bthe Granary C123 (P.

The volume offers a contextualized edition of thirty-seven documents found in a single structure, a large granary (C123) originally built in the first century CE, in addition to an analysis of the archaeology and history of the structure. The documents are presented with an introduction, transcription of the original Greek or Latin, translation, commentary, and images. A unique community prayer to the emperor and gods (827) is the volume's most notable contribution. The other papyri are a mix of private and public documents (petitions, declarations, letters, lists, etc.) that date from between the first century BCE and the fourth century CE. The typological and chronological mix of texts shows that they do not form an undisturbed archive but were rather a dump of wastepaper and other household objects. Michigan's excavated papyri are here presented for the first time on the basis of their archaeological find spot rather than being organized according to content. The volume's introduction provides a possible model for analyzing legacy data from the Karanis excavations stored at the University of Michigan. The book will be of interest to papyrologists, ancient historians, and archaeologists of Greco-Roman Egypt.  aIn Greek and English.  aDescription based on information from publisher.20aUniversity of Michigan.bLibrary.kManuscript.nP.

Law's complicity with imperial and neocolonial practices occurs when courts inscribe and repeat the fabulous tales that provide an alibi for archaic sovereign acts that persist in the present. The United Kingdom's depopulation of islands in the Indian Ocean to serve the United States' neoimperial interests, Australia's exile and abandonment of refugees on remote islands, the failure to acknowledge genocidal acts or colonial dispossession, and the memorial work of the South African Constitution after apartheid are all sustained by historical fictions. This history-work of law constitutes an archive where sovereign violence is mediated, dissimulated, and sustained. Stewart Motha extends the concept of the "archive," as site of origin and source of authority, to signifying what law does in preserving and disavowing the past at the same time. Sovereignty is often cast as a limit-concept, constituent force, determining the boundary of law. Archiving Sovereignty reverses this to explain how judicial pronouncements inscribe and sustain extravagant claims to exceptionality and sovereign solitude. This wide-ranging, critical work distinguishes between myths that sustain neocolonial orders and fictions that generate new forms of political and ethical life.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aSociological jurisprudence. 0aSovereigntyxSocial aspects. 0aBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryxInternational statusxSocial aspects. 0aChagossiansxLegal status, laws, etc.xSocial aspects. 0aRefugeesxLegal status, laws, etc.xSocial aspectszAustralia. 0aAboriginal AustraliansxLegal status, laws, etc.xSocial aspects. 0aTransitional justicexSocial aspectszSouth Africa. 0aPost-apartheid erazSouth Africa. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher. 0aLaw, meaning, and violence.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.721874303692nam a22003973i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000450012702400300017204000270020204300120022905000220024110000410026324501130030424600480041724600750046526400650054026400100060530000580061533600260067333700260069933800360072550400510076150505730081252014070138558800530279261001220284565000470296765000470301465100550306165500220311671000640313885600920320220180830150618.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180828t20182018miu     ob    000 1 eng d  a9780472123995qelectronic book  z9780472130887qhardcoverqalkaline paper7 a10.3998/mpub.98269742doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU  an-us---14aJK2265b.W53 20181 aWickham-Jones, Mark,d1962-eauthor.10aWhatever happened to party government? :bcontroversies in American political science /cMark Wickham-Jones.30aControversies in American political science13aControversies in the American Political Science Association, 1945-1952 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (xxiii, 403 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aPreface -- Abbreviations -- A Note on the Text and Sources -- Prologue -- Introduction: The Debate about Party Government -- Drafting a Report, 1946-1950 -- Arguments within APSA -- The Public Reception -- The Academic Debate -- The Responsible Party Government Model -- Toward a More Responsible Two- Party System and British Politics -- American Political Science and the United Kingdom after 1945 -- V.

Highly critical of the existing state of affairs, the report became extremely controversial: before publication, scholars attacked the committee's draft and suggested it should be suppressed. When released it received a barrage of criticisms. Most academics concluded it was an ill-conceived and mistaken initiative. Mark Wickham-Jones provides the first full, archival-based assessment of the arguments within APSA about political parties and the 1950 report. He details the report's failure to generate wider discussion between media, politicians, and the White House. He examines whether it was dominated by a dogmatic attachment to "party government," and charts the relationship between behavioralists and institutionalists. He also discusses the political dimension to research during the McCarthyite years, and reflects on the nature of American political science in the years after 1945, the period in which behavioralism (which privileges the influence of individuals over institutions) became dominant. Detailing APSA's most direct and significant intervention in the political process, Wickham-Jones makes an important contribution to debates that remain in the forefront of discussions about American politics.  aDescription based on information from publisher.20aAmerican Political Science Association.bCommittee on Political Parties.tToward a more responsible two-party system. 0aPolitical partieszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aTwo-party systemszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1945-1953. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.982697402964cam  2200361 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000310016302400300019404000270022404300120025105000230026310000290028624501500031526400550046530000220052033600260054233700260056833800360059450400510063052014950068158800570217665000390223365000470227265000530231965000550237265500220242771000610244985600920251020180904113103.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180529s2018    miua    ob   s001 0 eng    a9780472124008q(electronic book)  a0472124005q(electronic book)  z9780472073870q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.97658042doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  an-us---14aE184.M88bG55 20181 aGillum, Rachel,eauthor.10aMuslims in a post-9/11 America :ba survey of attitudes and beliefs and their implications for U.S. national security policy /cRachel M.

While most research on Muslim Americans focuses on Arab Muslims, a quarter of the Muslim American population, Rachel Gillum includes perspectives of Muslims from various ethnic and national communities-from African Americans to those of Pakistani, Iranian, or Eastern European descent. Using interviews and one of the largest nationwide surveys of Muslim Americans to date, Gillum examines more than three generations of Muslim American immigrants to assess how segments of the Muslim American community are integrating into the U.S. social fabric, and how they respond to post-9/11 policy changes. Gillum's findings challenge perceptions of Muslims as a homogeneous, isolated, un-American, and potentially violent segment of the U.S. population. Despite these realities, negative political rhetoric around Muslim Americans persists. The findings suggest that the policies designed to keep America safe from terrorist attacks may have eroded one of law enforcement's greatest assets in the fight against violent extremism-a relationship of trust and goodwill between the Muslim American community and the U.S. government. Gillum argues for policies and law enforcement tactics that will bring nuanced understandings of this diverse category of Americans and build trust, rather than alienate Muslim communities.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aMuslimszUnited StatesxAttitudes. 0aMuslimszUnited StatesxSocial conditions. 0aSeptember 11 Terrorist Attacks, 2001xInfluence. 0aIslam and politicszUnited StatesxPublic opinion. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.976580402446nam a22003493i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000310016302400300019404000270022405000220025110000300027324500900030326400650039330000390045833600260049733700260052333800360054949000560058550400510064152010970069258800570178965000110184665000260185765500220188371000610190583000380196685600920200420180904112500.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180308s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng    a9780472124015q(electronic book)  a0472124013q(electronic book)  z9780472130894q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.99097832doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU14aHQ1073b.D87 20181 aDurnovaÃÅ, Anna,eauthor.14aThe politics of intimacy :brethinking the end-of-life controversy /cAnna DurnovaÃÅ. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018]  a1 online resource (xv, 285 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aConfigurations : critical studies of world politics  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDebates on the end-of-life controversy are complex because they seem to highjack national and cultural traditions. Where previous books have focused on ideological grounds, The Politics of Intimacy explores dying as the site where policies are negotiated and implemented. Intimacy comprises the emotional experience of the end of life and how we acknowledge it-or not-through institutions. This process shows that end-of-life controversy relies on the conflict between the individual and these institutions, a relationship that is the cornerstone of Western liberal democracies. Through interviews with mourners, stakeholders, and medical professionals, examination of media debates in France and the Czech Republic, DurnovaÃÅ shows that liberal institutions, in their attempts to accommodate the emotional experience at the end of life, ultimately fail. She describes this deadlock as the "politics of intimacy," revealing that political institutions deploy power through collective acknowledgment of individual emotions but fail to maintain this recognition because of this same experience.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aDeath. 0aIntimacy (Psychology) 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aConfigurations (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.990978304711nam a22005053i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702000290015602400300018504000270021504300120024205000130025424501620026724600560042926400650048526400100055030000550056033600260061533700260064133800360066750504100070352017780111352003580289158800530324961000780330261000780338065000500345865000390350865000530354765000650360065000710366565000470373665000540378365500220383770000520385970000520391170000300396370000280399370000280402171000640404985600920411320180830152244.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180827t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124022qelectronic book  z9780472073887qhardcover  z9780472053889qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.96847892doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU  an-us---10aE185.61504aThe harvest of American racism :bthe political meaning of violence in the summer of 1967 /cedited by Robert Shellow ; with a foreword by Michael C.

Marx, David O. Sears -- Appendix A: Calendars of Disturbances in 1967, Showing Intensity and Duration -- Appendix B: The Commission's Report in Two Guises: The Role of Politics3 a"In the summer of 1967, in response to violent demonstrations that rocked 164 U.S. cities, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, a.k.a. the Kerner Commission, was formed. The Commission sought reasons for the disturbances, including the role that law enforcement played. Chief among its research projects was a study of 23 American cities, headed by social psychologist Robert Shellow. An early draft of the scientists' analysis, titled "The Harvest of American Racism: The Political Meaning of Violence in the Summer of 1967," provoked the Commission's staff in November 1967 by uncovering political causes for the unrest; the team of researchers was fired, and the controversial report remained buried at the LBJ Presidential Library until now. The first publication of the Harvest report half a century later reveals that many of the issues it describes are still with us, including how cities might more effectively and humanely react to groups and communities in protest. In addition to the complete text of the suppressed Harvest report, the book includes an introduction by Robert Shellow that provides useful historical context; personal recollections from four of the report's surviving social scientists, Robert Shellow, David Boesel, Gary T. Marx, and David O. Sears; and an appendix outlining the differences between the unpublished Harvest analysis and the well-known Kerner Commission Report that followed it. "The [Harvest of American Racism] report was rejected by Johnson administration functionaries as being far too radical-politically 'unviable'... Social science can play an extremely positive role in fighting racial and other injustice and inequality, but only if it is matched with a powerful political will to implement the findings.8 aThat will has never come from within an American presidential administration-that will has only been forged in black and other radical communities' movements for justice. The political power for change, as incremental as it has been, has come from within those communities. Washington responds, it does not lead." -from the Foreword by Michael C.

The freak acquires greater significance in a globalized, neoliberal world that defines the "abnormal" as one who does not conform mentally, physically, or emotionally and is unable or unwilling to follow the economic and cultural norms of the institutions in power. Freak Performances examines the continuing effects of colonialism on modern Latin American identities, with a particular focus on the way it has constructed the body of the other through performance. Theater questions the representations of these bodies, as it enables the empowerment of the silenced other; the freak as a spectacle of otherness finds in performance an opportunity for re-appropriation by artists resisting the dominant authority. Through an analysis of experimental theater, dance theater, performance art, and gallery-based installation art across eight countries, Analola Santana explores the theoretical issues shaped by the encounters and negotiations between different bodies in the current Latin American landscape.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aTheaterxPolitical aspectszLatin America. 0aTheater and societyzLatin America. 0aMonsters in the theater. 0aOther (Philosophy) in the performing arts. 0aPostcolonialismxSocial aspectszLatin America. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.989917302739nam a22003373i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702000480015602400300020404000270023405000170026110000270027824501100030526400650041526400100048030000310049033600260052133700260054733800360057350400510060950502780066052011700093858800530210860000620216165500220222371000640224585600920230920180830144306.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180827t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124091qelectronic book  z9780472053933qpaperback  z9780472073931qhardcover ;qacid-free paper7 a10.3998/mpub.97942952doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU10aPS3515.A93631 aSmith, Derik,eauthor.10aRobert Hayden in verse :bnew histories of African American poetry and the black arts era /cDerik Smith. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource ( pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aIntroduction -- Quarreling in the Movement -- The "Cosmic Hero" -- The Aesthetics of Changing Churches -- Witch Doctors -- "beckoning beckoning"; -- "Shadow of time.

While Hayden's poetry often reflected aspects of the African American experience, he resisted attempts to categorize his poetry in racial terms. This fresh appreciation of Hayden's work recontextualizes his achievements against the backdrop of the Black Arts Movement and traces his influence on contemporary African American poets. Placing Hayden at the heart of a history of African American poetry and culture spanning the Harlem Renaissance to the Hip-Hop era, the book explains why Hayden is now a canonical figure in 20th-century American literature. In deep readings that focus on Hayden's religiousness, class consciousness, and historical vision, author Derik Smith inverts earlier scholarly accounts that figure Hayden as an outsider at odds with the militancy of the Black Arts movement. Robert Hayden in Verse offers detailed descriptions of the poet's vigorous contributions to 1960s discourse about art, modernity, and blackness to show that the poet was, in fact, an earnest participant in Black Arts-era political and aesthetic debates."  aDescription based on information from publisher.10aHayden, Robert,d1913-1980xCriticism and interpretation. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.979429504185nam a22004693i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702000290015602400300018504000270021505000240024210000400026624501460030624600620045226400650051426400100057930000420058933600260063133700260065733800360068349000450071950400510076450506510081552016060146658800530307265000260312565000350315165000420318665000310322865000530325965000540331265000440336665000450341065500220345570000500347771000760352783000200360385600920362320180830140550.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180827t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124107qelectronic book  z9780472073948qhardcover  z9780472053940qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.93653502doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU14aPR756.A87bR63 20181 aRodas, Julia Miele,d1965-eauthor.10aAutistic disturbances :btheorizing autism poetics from the DSM to Robinson Crusoe /cJulia Miele Rodas ; with a foreword by Melanie Yergeau.30aTheorizing autism poetics from the DSM to Robinson Crusoe 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (xviii, 230 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCorporealities: discourses of disability  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aForeword by Melanie Yergeau -- Preface: Involuntarity and intentionality -- Chapter one: Introduction -- Chapter two: Articulating autism poetics -- Chapter three: On the surprising elasticity of taxonomical rhetoric -- Chapter four: Nothingness himself -- Chapter four-and-a-half: (Why "Bartleby" doesn't live here) -- Chapter five: Neuroqueer narration in Charlotte BronteÃÅs Villette -- Chapter six: The absence of the object: autistic voice and literary architecture in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein -- Chapter seven: Autism and narrative invention in Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe -- Unconclusion: Because the butterfly: autistic infinitudes.3 aWhile research on autism has sometimes focused on special talents or abilities, autism is typically characterized as impoverished or defective when it comes to language. Autistic Disturbances reveals the ways interpreters have failed to register the real creative valence of autistic language and offers a theoretical framework for understanding the distinctive aesthetics of autistic rhetoric and semiotics. Reinterpreting characteristic autistic verbal practices such as repetition in the context of a more widely respected literary canon, Julia Miele Rodas argues that autistic language is actually an essential part of mainstream literary aesthetics, visible in poetry by Walt Whitman and Gertrude Stein, in novels by Charlotte BronteÃà and Daniel Defoe, in life writing by Andy Warhol, and even in writing by figures from popular culture. Autistic Disturbances pursues these resonances and explores the tensions of language and culture that lead to the classification of some verbal expression as disordered while other, similar expression enjoys prized status as literature. It identifies the most characteristic patterns of autistic expression-repetition, monologue, ejaculation, verbal ordering or list-making, and neologism-and adopts new language to describe and reimagine these categories in aesthetically productive terms. In so doing, the book seeks to redress the place of verbal autistic language, to argue for the value and complexity of autistic ways of speaking, and to invite recognition of an obscured tradition of literary autism at the very center of Anglo-American text culture.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aAutism in literature. 0aAutistic people in literature. 0aLanguage and languages in literature. 0aAutistic peoplexLanguage. 0aEnglish prose literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aAmerican prose literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aEnglish fictionxHistory and criticism. 0aAmerican fictionxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.1 aYergeau, Melanie,d1984-ewriter of foreword.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher. 0aCorporealities.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.936535002959cam  2200421 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000150012902000310014402000310017502400300020604000270023604300120026305000140027524501610028924600830045026400650053330000220059833600260062033700260064633800360067250400510070852011620075958800570192165000750197865000550205365000380210865000440214665000350219065000380222565000430226370000410230670000370234771000610238485600920244520180904114931.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180612s2018    miu     ob   s001 0 eng    a9780472124114q(electronic book)  a0472124110  z9780472073955q(hardcover)  z9780472053957q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.98921492doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  an-us---10aPS153.H5600aDialectical imaginaries :bmaterialist approaches to U.S. Latino/a literature in the age of neoliberalism /cMarcial GonzaÃÅlez and Carlos Gallego, editors.30aMaterialist approaches to U.S. Latino/a literature in the age of neoliberalism 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDialectical Imaginaries brings together essays that analyze the effects of class conflict and capitalist ideology on contemporary works of U.S. Latino/a literature. The editors argue that recent global events have compelled contemporary scholars to reexamine traditional interpretive models that center on identity politics and an ethics of multiculturalism. The volume seeks to demonstrate that materialist methodologies have a greater critical reach than other methods, and that Latino/a literary criticism should be more attuned to interpretive approaches that draw on Marxism and other globalizing social theories. The contributors analyze a wide range of literary works in fiction, poetry, drama, and memoir by writers including Rudolfo Anaya, Gloria AnzalduÃÅa, Daniel Borzutzky, Angie Cruz, Sergio de la Pava, MoÃÅnica de la Torre, Sergio Elizondo, Juan Felipe Herrera, Rolando Hinojosa, Quiara AlegriÃÅa Hudes, Lin-Manuel Miranda, OÃÅscar MartiÃÅnez, CherriÃÅe Moraga, UrayoaÃÅn Noel, Emma PeÃÅrez, Pedro Pietri, Miguel PinÃÉero, Ernesto QuinÃÉoÃÅnez, Ronald Ruiz, Hector Tobar, Rodrigo Toscano, Alfredo VeÃÅa, Helena MariÃÅa Viramontes, and others.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAmerican literaturexHispanic American authorsxHistory and criticism. 0aCapitalism and literaturezUnited StatesxHistory. 0aMarxist criticismzUnited States. 0aPolitics and literaturezUnited States. 0aSocial conflict in literature. 0aHispanic Americans in literature. 0aLiterature and societyzUnited States.1 aGonzaÃÅlez, Marcial,d1953-eeditor.1 aGallego, Carlos,d1971-eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.989214902747nam a22004093i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400300015604000270018604300120021305000130022510000340023824500770027224600370034926400650038626400100045130000350046133600260049633700260052233800360054849000560058450400510064050501820069152010210087358800530189465000590194765000340200665100310204065000500207165500220212171000640214383000380220785600920224520180830150812.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180828t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124138qelectronic book  z9780472130948qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.99100722doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU  aa-tu---10aJZ1253.51 aWigen, Einar,d1981-eauthor.10aState of translation :bTurkey in interlingual relations /cEinar Wigen.30aTurkey in interlingual relations 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (294 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aConfigurations : critical studies of world politics  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aForeword -- Acknowledgments -- Note on Transliteration and Spelling -- Introduction -- Concepts -- Civilization -- Empire -- Citizenship -- Democracy -- Teleology -- Conclusion.3 aInternational politics often requires two or more languages. The resulting interlingual relations mean translation, either by interpreters who are quite literally in the middle of conversations, or by bilingual statesmen who negotiate internationally in one language and then legitimize domestically in another. Since no two languages are the same, what can be argued in one language may be impossible in another. Political concepts can thus be significantly reformulated in the translation process. State of Translation examines this phenomenon using the case of how 19th-century Ottoman and later Turkish statesmen struggled to reconcile their arguments in external languages (French, then English) with those in their internal language (Ottoman, later Turkish), and in the process further entangled them. Einar Wigen shows how this process structured social relations between the Ottoman state and its interlocutors, both domestically and internationally, and shaped the dynamics of Turkish relations with Europe.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aLanguage and international relationszTurkeyxHistory. 0aDiplomacyxLanguagexHistory. 0aTurkeyxForeign relations. 0aTurkish languagexPolitical aspectsxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aConfigurations (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.991007202686cam  22003738i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000370010702000150014402000310015902000310019002400300022104000270025104300120027805000110029010000400030124500920034126400650043330000220049833600260052033700260054633800360057252012820060858800570189065000500194765000370199765000700203465000330210465500220213771000610215985600920222020180904114559.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180525s2018    miu     ob    000 0 eng    a2018025345  a9780472124183q(electronic book)  a0472124188  z9780472073924q(hardcover)  z9780472053926q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.92710942doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  an-us---10aHV94711 aJacobsen, Carolc(Artist),eauthor.10aFor dear life :bwomen's decriminalization and human rights in focus /cCarol Jacobsen. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aFor Dear Life chronicles feminist and artist Carol Jacobsen's deep commitment to the causes of justice and human rights, and focuses a critical lens on an American criminal-legal regime that imparts racist, gendered, and classist modes of punishment to women lawbreakers. Jacobsen's tireless work with and for women prisoners is charted in this rich assemblage of images and texts that reveal the collective strategies she and the prisoners have employed to receive justice. The book gives evidence that women's lawbreaking is often an effort to survive gender-based violence. The faces, letters, and testimonies of dozens of incarcerated women with whom Jacobsen has worked present a visceral yet politicized chorus of voices against the criminal-legal systems that fail us all. Their voices are joined by those of leading feminist scholars in essays that illuminate the arduous methods of dissent that Jacobsen and the others have employed to win freedom for more than a dozen women sentenced to life imprisonment, and to free many more from torturous prison conditions. The book is a document to Jacobsen's love and lifelong commitment to creating feminist justice and freedom, and to the efficacy of her artistic, legal, and extralegal political actions on behalf of women.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aWomen prisonersxCivil rightszUnited States. 0aFemale offenderszUnited States. 0aDiscrimination in criminal justice administrationzUnited States. 0aHuman rightszUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.927109402489nam a22003733i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400300015604000270018605000220021310000270023524500800026226400650034226400100040730000350041733600260045233700260047833800360050449000200054050502310056052009150079158800530170665000290175965000280178865000450181665000430186165500220190471000760192683000210200285600920202320180830135839.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180827t20182018miu     o     000 0 eng d  a9780472124213qelectronic book  z9780472037285qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.99499632doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU00aPN1081b.M48 20181 aMetres, Philip,d1970-14aThe sound of listening :bpoetry as refuge and resistance /cPhilip Metres. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (216 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aPoets on poetry0 aPoetry as refuge and resistance -- From the PEN Ten interview with Randa Jarrar -- From "At the Borders of Our Tongue" : a dialogue with Fady Joudah -- Parsing Arias : a dialogue through "Abu Ghraib Arias" with Micah Cavaleri.3 aPhilip Metres stakes a claim for the cultural work that poems can perform-from providing refuge to embodying resistance, from recovering silenced voices to building a more just world, in communities of solitude and solidarity. Gathering a decade of his writing on poetry, he widens our sense of poetry as a way of being in the world, proposing that poems can offer a permeability to marginalized voices and a shelter from the imperial noise and despair that can silence us. The Sound of Listening ranges between expansive surveys of the poetry of 9/11, Arab American poetry, documentary poetry, landscape poetry, installation poetry, and peace poetry; personal explorations of poets such as Adrienne Rich, Khalil Gibran, Lev Rubinstein, and Arseny Tarkovsky; and intimate dialogues with Randa Jarrar, Fady Joudah, and Micah Cavaleri, that illuminate Metres's practice of listening in his 2015 work, Sand Opera.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPolitics and literature. 0aPolitics in literature. 0aPolitical poetryxHistory and criticism. 0aProtest poetryxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher. 0aPoets on poetry.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.994996303066nam a22003613i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000450012702400300017204000270020205000110022910000350024024500840027526400650035926400100042430000540043433600260048833700260051433800360054050400510057650502970062752013740092458800530229865000290235165000480238065000590242865000540248765500220254171000490256385600920261220180830125704.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180824t20182018miu     ob    001 | eng d  a9780472124237qelectronic book  z9780472130979qhardcoverqalkaline paper7 a10.3998/mpub.94499912doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU10aPN32091 aJones, Megan Sanborn,eauthor.10aContemporary Mormon pageantry :bseeking after the dead /cMegan Sanborn Jones. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (336 pages) :b10 illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 tThe past is never dead --tReanimating American new pageantry --tPerforming near the dead : pageant stages and holy ground --tPerforming the dead : actors from both sides of the veil --tPerforming with the dead : feeling the spirit of holy ghosts --tConclusion : a great time to be alive.3 aIn Contemporary Mormon Pageantry, theater scholar Megan Sanborn Jones looks at Mormon pageants, outdoor theatrical productions that celebrate church theology, reenact church history, and bring to life stories from the Book of Mormon. She examines four annual pageants in the United States-the Hill Cumorah Pageant in upstate New York, the Manti Pageant in Utah, the Nauvoo Pageant in Illinois, and the Mesa Easter Pageant in Arizona. The nature and extravagance of the pageants vary by location, with some live orchestras, dancing, and hundreds of costumed performers, mostly local church members. Based on deep historical research and enhanced by the author's interviews with pageant producers and cast members as well as the author's own experiences as a participant-observer, the book reveals the strategies by which these pageants resurrect the Mormon past on stage. Jones analyzes the place of the productions within the American theatrical landscape and draws connections between the Latter-day Saints theology of the redemption of the dead and Mormon pageantry in the three related sites of sacred space, participation, and spectatorship. Using a combination of religious and performance theory, Jones demonstrates that Mormon pageantry is a rich and complex site of engagement between theater, theology, and praxis that explores the saving power of performance.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPageantszUnited States. 0aPageantsxReligious aspectsxMormon Church. 0aAmerican dramaxMormon authorsxHistory and criticism. 0aReligious drama, AmericanxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.944999103787nam a22004093i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702000290015602400300018504000270021504300120024205000220025410000260027624500910030226400650039326400100045830000520046833600260052033700260054633800360057249000250060850400510063350502630068452019330094758800530288065000590293365000590299265000620305165000290311365500220314271000640316483000570322885600920328520180830145628.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180827t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124244qelectronic book  z9780472074006qhardcover  z9780472054008qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.98773862doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU  af-sa---00aDT1758b.S25 20181 aSaint, Lily,eauthor.10aBlack cultural life in South Africa :breception, apartheid, and ethics /cLily Saint. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (208 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aAfrican perspectives  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aIntroduction: Ethical theory is postcolonial theory -- Black books, White bodies: reimagining the passcheck -- "Blood and thunder": popular film and Black spectatorship at the midcentury -- Race, reading, and the photocomic -- Writing ethics after apartheid.3 aUnder apartheid, black South Africans experienced severe material and social disadvantages occasioned by the government's policies, and they had limited time for entertainment. Still, they closely engaged with an array of textual and visual cultures in ways that shaped their responses to this period of ethical crisis. Marshaling forms of historical evidence that include passbooks, memoirs, American "B" movies, literary and genre fiction, magazines, and photocomics, Black Cultural Life in South Africa considers the importance of popular genres and audiences in the relationship between ethical consciousness and aesthetic engagement. This study provocatively posits that states of oppression, including colonial and postcolonial rule, can elicit ethical responses to imaginative identification through encounters with popular culture, and it asks whether and how they carry over into ethical action. Its consideration of how globalized popular culture "travels" not just in material form, but also through the circuits of the imaginary, opens a new window for exploring the ethical and liberatory stakes of popular culture. Each chapter focuses on a separate genre, yet the overall interdisciplinary approach to the study of genre and argument for an expansion of ethical theory that draws on texts beyond the Western canon speak to growing concerns about studying genres and disciplines in isolation. Freed from oversimplified treatments of popular forms-common to cultural studies and ethical theory alike-this book demonstrates that people can do things with mass culture that reinvigorate ethical life. Lily Saint's new volume will interest Africanists across the humanities and the social sciences, and scholars of Anglophone literary, globalization, and cultural studies; race; ethical theories and philosophies; film studies; book history and material cultures; and the burgeoning field of comics and graphic novels.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aBlackszSouth AfricaxSocial conditionsy20th century. 0aBlackszSouth AfricaxSocial conditionsy21st century. 0aPopular culturexMoral and ethical aspectszSouth Africa. 0aApartheidzSouth Africa. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aAfrican perspectives (University of Michigan.

The ideal legislator should assess evidence, update his or her beliefs with new information, and sometimes be willing to change course. In practice, however, lawmakers face criticism from the media, the public, and their colleagues for "flip-flopping." Legislators may also only appear to change positions in some cases as a means of voting strategically. This book presents a systematic examination of legislative indecision in American politics. This might occur via "waffling"-where a legislator cosponsors a bill, then votes against it at roll call. Or it might occur when a legislator votes one way on a bill, then switches her vote to the other side. In Indecision in American Legislatures, Jeffrey J. Harden and Justin H. Kirkland develop a theoretical framework to explain indecision itself, as well as the public's attitudes toward indecision. They test their expectations with data sources from American state legislatures, the U.S. Congress, and survey questions administered to American citizens. Understanding legislative indecision from both the legislator and citizen perspectives is important for discussions about the quality of representation in American politics.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aLegislative bodieszUnited States. 0aLegislative bodieszUnited StatesxEthics. 0aLegislative bodieszUnited StatesxStates. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmentxDecision making.1 aKirkland, Justin H.,eauthor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aLegislative politics & policy making.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.937947402520nam a22003733i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702000290015602400300018504000270021505000110024210000300025324501110028326400650039426400100045930000510046933600260052033700260054633800360057250400510060852010820065958800530174165000380179465000490183265000170188165500220189870000310192070000390195171000640199085600920205420180830150358.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180828t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124275qelectronic book  z9780472074013qhardcover  z9780472054015qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.94489562doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU10aHQ77.91 aTaylor, Jami K.,eauthor.14aThe remarkable rise of transgender rights /cJami K.

Over the past twenty-five years, the transgender movement has gained statutory nondiscrimination protections at the state and local levels, hate crimes protections in a number of states, inclusion in a federal law against hate crimes, legal victories in the courts, and increasingly favorable policies in bureaucracies at all levels. It has achieved these victories despite the relatively small number of trans people and despite the widespread discrimination, poverty, and violence experienced by many in the transgender community. This is a remarkable achievement in a political system where public policy often favors those with important resources that the transgender community lacks: access, money, and voters. The Remarkable Rise of Transgender Rights explains the growth of the transgender rights movement despite its marginalized status within the current political opportunity structure.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aTransgender peoplexCivil rights. 0aTransgender peoplexLegal status, laws, etc. 0aSex and law. 4aElectronic books.1 aLewis, Daniel C.,eauthor.1 aHaider-Markel, Donald P.,eauthor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.944895603006nam a22004213i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000470012702400300017404000270020404300120023105000140024310000320025724500850028926400650037426400100043930000560044933600260050533700260053133800360055750400510059350501980064452011950084258800530203765000540209065100520214465000250219665000360222165000470225765000360230465100350234065500220237570000310239771000640242885600920249220180830150139.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180828t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124299qelectronic book  z9780472131013qhardcover ;qalkaline paper7 a10.3998/mpub.99466112doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU  an-us---10aUG1242.D71 aWalsh, James Igoe,eauthor.10aDrones and support for the use of force /cJames Igoe Walsh and Marcus Schulzke. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (256 pages)b23 tables, 15 charts  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aDrones and support for the use of force -- Drones, casualties, and attitudes -- Drones and policy objectives -- Drones and moral hazard -- Drones and sensitivity to civilian harm -- Conclusion.3 a"Combat drones are transforming attitudes about the use of military force. Military casualties and the costs of conflict sap public support for war and for political and military leaders. Combat drones offer an unprecedented ability to reduce these costs by increasing accuracy, reducing the risks to civilians, and protecting military personnel from harm. These advantages should make drone strikes more popular than operations involving ground troops. Yet many critics believe drone warfare will make political leaders too willing to authorize wars, weakening constraints on the use of force. Because combat drones are relatively new, these arguments have been based on anecdotes, a handful of public opinion polls, or theoretical speculation. Drones and Support for the Use of Force uses experimental research to analyze the effects of combat drones on Americans' support for the use of force. The authors' findings-that drones have had important but nuanced effects on support for the use of force-have implications for democratic control of military action and civil-military relations and provide insight into how the proliferation of military technologies influences foreign policy."  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aDrone aircraftxGovernment policyzUnited States. 0aUnited StatesxMilitary policyxPublic opinion. 0aWarxPublic opinion. 0aWarxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aDrone aircraftxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aWar and societyzUnited States. 0aUnited StatesxPublic opinion. 4aElectronic books.1 aSchulzke, Marcus,eauthor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.994661102645nam a22003613i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400300015604000270018605000150021324501270022824600440035526400650039926400100046430000350047433600260050933700260053533800360056149000210059750400510061852012310066958800530190060000520195365500220200570000400202770000380206771000640210583000220216985600920219120180830151423.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180827t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124404qelectronic book  z9780472037292qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.99583912doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU10aPS3565.S8400aEverywoman her own theology :bon the poetry of Alicia Suskin Ostriker /cedited by Martha Nell Smith and Julie R.

In all her writings, both the feminist and the human engage fiercely with the material and metaphysical world. Ostriker is a poet concerned with questions of social justice, equality, religion, and how to live in a world marked by both beauty and tragedy. Everywoman Her Own Theology: On the Poetry of Alicia Suskin Ostriker engages Ostriker's poetry from throughout her career, including her first volume Songs, her award-winning collection The Imaginary Lover, and her more recent work in the collections No Heaven, the volcano sequence, The Old Woman, the Tulip, and the Dog, and Waiting for the Light. Like her literary criticism and essays, Ostriker's poetry explores themes of feminism, Jewish life, family, and social justice. With insightful essays-some newly written for this collection-poets and literary critics including Toi Derricotte, Daisy Fried, Cynthia Hogue, Tony Hoagland, and Eleanor Wilner illuminate and open new pathways for critical engagement with Alicia Ostriker's lifetime of poetic work."  aDescription based on information from publisher.10aOstriker, AliciaxCriticism and interpretation. 4aElectronic books.1 aSmith, Martha Nell,d1953-eeditor.1 aEnszer, Julie R.,d1970-eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body. 0aUnder discussion.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.995839103673nam a22003853i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400300015604000270018604300120021305000230022510000380024824501520028624600820043826400650052026400100058530000560059533600260065133700260067733800360070350400510073950507390079052012940152958800530282365000440287665000330292065500220295370000370297571000760301277001070308885600920319520180830140709.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180827t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124411qelectronic book  z9780472131075qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.95268772doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU  an-us---14aJK1764b.R685 20181 aRouse, Stella M.,d1972-eauthor.14aThe politics of millennials :bpolitical beliefs and policy preferences of America's most diverse generation /cStella M.

It exceeds one-quarter of the population and is the most diverse generation in U.S. history. Millennials grew up experiencing September 11, the global proliferation of the Internet and of smart phones, and the worst economic recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Their young adulthood has been marked by rates of unemployment and underemployment surpassing those of their parents and grandparents, making them the first generation in the modern era to have higher rates of poverty than their predecessors at the same age. The Politics of Millennials explores the factors that shape the Millennial generation's unique political identity, how this identity conditions political choices, and how this cohort's diversity informs political attitudes and beliefs. Few scholars have empirically identified and studied the political attitudes and policy preferences of Millennials, despite the size and influence of this generation. This book explores politics from a generational perspective, first, and then combines this with other group identities that include race and ethnicity to bring a new perspective to how we examine identity politics.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aPolitical participationzUnited States. 0aGeneration YzUnited States. 4aElectronic books.1 aRoss, Ashley D.,d1981-eauthor.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher.0 iSupplement (work):aRouse, Stella M.,tPolitics of millennials.h1 online resource (50 digital images)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.952687703416nam a22003493i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400300015604000270018605000110021324501370022426400650036126400100042630000510043633600260048733700260051333800360053950400510057552018300062652001880245658800530264465000400269765000490273765500220278670000380280870000640284671000640291085600920297420180830151035.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180827t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472124428qelectronic book  z9780472131082qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.99052632doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU10aPA301300aEngaging classical texts in the contemporary world :bfrom narratology to reception /cLouise Pratt and C.

In this collection, 12 top scholars apply major critical approaches from other academic fields to open new channels for dialogue between ancient texts and the contemporary world. This volume considers perennial favorites of classical literature--the Iliad and Odyssey, Greek tragedy, Roman comedy, the Argonautica, and Ovid's Metamorphoses--and their influence on popular entertainment from Shakespeare's plays to Hollywood's toga films. It also engages with unusual and intriguing texts across the centuries, including a curious group of epigrams by Artemidorus found on the island sanctuary of Thera, mysterious fragments of two Aeschylean tragedies, and modern-day North African novels. These essays engage an array of theoretical approaches from other fields-narratology, cognitive literary theory, feminist theory, New Historicist approaches to gender and sexuality, and politeness theory--without forsaking more traditional philological methods. A new look at hospitality in the Argonautica shows its roots in the changed historical circumstances of the Hellenistic world. The doubleness of Helen and her phantom in Euripides' Helen is even more complex than previously noted. Particularly illuminating is the recurrent application of reception studies, yielding new takes on the ancient reception of Homer by Apollonius and of Aeschylus by Macrobius, the reception of Plautus by Shakespeare, and more contemporary examples from the worlds of cinema and literature. Students and scholars of classics will find much in these new interpretations and approaches to familiar texts that will expand their intellectual horizons.8 aSpecialists in other fields, particularly English, comparative literature, film studies, and gender and sexuality studies, will also find these essays directly relevant to their work.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aClassical literaturexAppreciation. 0aClassical literaturexHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.1 aPratt, Louise H.,d1960-eeditor.1 aSampson, C.

Yet, unlike that of their male counterparts, the study of women's reading practices and book ownership has been an elusive and largely overlooked field. In thirteen probing essays, Women's Bookscapes brings together the work of internationally renowned scholars investigating key questions about early modern British women's figurative, material, and cultural relationships with books. What constitutes evidence of women's readerly engagement? How did women use books to achieve personal, political, religious, literary, economic, social, familial, or communal goals? How does new evidence of women's libraries and book usage challenge received ideas about gender in relation to knowledge, education, confessional affiliations, family ties, and sociability? How do digital tools offer new possibilities for the recovery of information on early modern women readers? The volume's three-part structure highlights case studies of individual readers and their libraries; analyses of readers and readership in the context of their interpretive communities; and new types of scholarly evidence-lists of confiscated books and convent rules, for example-as well as new methodologies and technologies for ongoing research in the field. These essays dismantle binaries of private and public; reading and writing; female and male literary engagement and production; and ownership and authorship. Women's Bookscapes is interdisciplinary, timely, cohesive, and concise. Its fresh and revisionary approaches cultivate this burgeoning field and diversify research and analytical methods for current and future scholars.8 aThe volume makes substantial contributions to scholarship on early modern material culture; book history and print culture; women's literary and cultural history; library studies; and reading and collecting practices more generally.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aEnglish literatureyEarly modern, 1500-1700xHistory and criticism. 0aWomen and literaturezGreat BritainxHistory. 0aWomen in popular culturezGreat BritainxHistory. 0aWomenxBooks and readingzGreat BritainxHistoryy19th century. 4aElectronic books.1 aSauer, Elizabeth,d1964-eeditor.1 aWhite, Micheline,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body,epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.990116503721cam  2200421 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000310009202000150012302400300013804000270016804200080019504300120020304900090021505000260022410000420025024501030029226400650039530000230046033600260048333700260050933800360053549000630057150400510063452018220068552002750250758800570278263000280283960000630286765000470293065000220297765000500299965000720304965100250312171000610314685600920320720180904114147.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180418s2018    miu     ob   s001 0 eng    a9780472130962q(hardcover)  a047213096X7 a10.3998/mpub.98771272doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  apcc  aa-ja---  aEY2L00aND1059.6.G4bJ33 20181 aJackson, Reginald R.,d1979-eauthor.10aTextures of mourning :bcalligraphy, mortality, and The Tale of Genji scrolls /cReginald Jackson. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018]  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aMichigan monograph series in Japanese studies ;vnumber 84  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aHow does mourning emerge to reshape Japanese visual culture? Textures of Mourning addresses this question by examining engrossing literary and visual portrayals of death and its aftermath from The Tale of Genji and its adaptations. Contending that the work of mourning unfolds through interwoven practices of reading, writing, painting, and public exhibition, Reginald Jackson charts how mourning spurs artistic composition, triggers visceral responses, and seduces spectators in both premodern and contemporary Japan. Textures of Mourning delineates the intimate relationship between mourning and reading at three historical tipping points: the height of imperial power in the early eleventh century, when the literary masterwork The Tale of Genji (1008) was written; the collapse of imperial hegemony in the late-twelfth century, when Genji's most famous handscroll adaptation was composed (1150); and the post-bubble recessionary context in which those handscrolls were refashioned as the "Resurrected Genji Handscrolls" (2006). As material objects wrought at comparable moments of social upheaval, these texts become vehicles through which to mourn perished ideals of vitality, prosperity, and belonging. Textures of Mourning is the first full-length manuscript in English to investigate these texts' complex relationship across eras. By analyzing dozens of sumptuous images, the book pursues mortality's progression over four sections-"Dying," "Decomposing," "Mourning," and "Resurrecting"-each of which contextualizes factual and fictional accounts of reckoning with death to discern the mechanics of mourning's labor. A major intervention of the book is to theorize how the riveting opacity, coarse materiality, and skewed temporality of premodern forms trouble modern regimes of looking, feeling, and knowing.  a Drawing upon scholarship in premodern Japanese literary studies, art history, and performance studies, the book's innovative trans-disciplinary readings reorient psychoanalytic criticism and performance theory to map the fluctuating topography of calligraphic gestures.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.00aGenji monogatari emaki.00aMurasaki Shikibu,d978?-tGenji monogatarivIllustrations. 0aScrolls, JapaneseyHeian period, 794-1185. 0aMortality in art. 0aCalligraphy, JapanesexPsychological aspects. 0aJapanese literatureyHeian period, 794-1185xHistory and criticism. 0aJapanxCivilization.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.987712703091nam a22004333i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000330010702000370014002000150017702000310019202400300022304000270025304300120028004900090029205000240030110000300032524500890035526400650044426400100050930000380051933600260055733700260058333800360060949000230064550400510066852013490071954201280206858800570219665000460225365000440229965500220234371000610236577000970242683000420252385600920256520180904102143.0m     o  d        cr un ---aaaaa180517t20182018miua    ob   s001 0 eng    a2018024343  a9780472900848q(open access)  a9780472123940q(electronic book)  a0472123947  z9780472130863q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.98471832doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  an-us---  aEY2L14aHE6204.U5bB75 20181 aBrennan, Sheila,eauthor.10aStamping American memory :bcollectors, citizens, and the post /cSheila A.

While millions of Americans collected stamps from the 1880s to the 1940s, Stamping American Memory is the first scholarly examination of stamp collecting culture and how stamps enabled citizens to engage their federal government in conversations about national life in early-twentieth-century America. By examining the civic conversations that emerged around stamp subjects and imagery, this work brings to light the role that these under- examined historical artifacts have played in carrying political messages. Sheila A. Brennan crafts a fresh synthesis that explores how the US postal service shaped Americans' concepts of national belonging, citizenship, and race through its commemorative stamp program. Designed to be saved as souvenirs, commemoratives circulated widely and stood as miniature memorials to carefully selected snapshots from the American past that also served the political needs of small interest groups. Stamping American Memory brings together the histories of the US postal service and the federal government, collecting, and philately through the lenses of material culture and memory to make a significant contribution to our understanding of this period in American history1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivativesuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aStamp collectingzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aPostage stampszUnited StatesxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.1 iSupplement (work):aBrennan, SheilatStamping American memoryh1 online resource (50 photos) 0aDigital humanities (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.984718303842nam a22004333i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000310009202000350012302000290015802000290018702400300021604000270024605000160027324501260028926400650041526400100048030000510049033600260054133700260056733800360059350400510062950512560068052007340193653600370267054201660270758800530287365000370292665000480296365000380301165000450304965000560309465000460315065500220319670000340321871000640325285600920331620180904124324.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180828t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472901029qopen access  z9780472123445qelectronic book  z9780472073726qhardcover  z9780472053728qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.97316162doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aPN1993.5.C400aEarly film culture in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Republican China :bkaleidoscopic histories /cedited by Emilie Yueh-yu Yeh. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource (364 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aIntroduction -- Part I.

Looking beyond relatively well-studied cities like Shanghai, these essays foreground cinema's relationship with imperialism and colonialism and emphasize the rapid development of cinema as a sociocultural institution. These essays examine where films were screened; how cinema-going as a social activity adapted from and integrated with existing social norms and practices; the extent to which Cantonese opera and other regional performance traditions were models for the development of cinematic conventions; the role foreign films played in the development of cinema as an industry in the Republican era; and much more.  aSponsored by Knowledge Unlatched1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 Unported licenseuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aMotion pictureszChinaxHistory. 0aMotion pictureszChinazHong KongxHistory. 0aMotion pictureszTaiwanxHistory. 0aMotion picture industryzChinaxHistory. 0aMotion picture industryzChinazHong KongxHistory. 0aMotion picture industryzTaiwanxHistory. 4aElectronic books.1 aYeh, Emilie Yueh-yu,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.973161603753nam a2200373 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000330012902000310016202000310019302400310022404000270025510000330028224500650031526400650038030000220044533600260046733700260049333800360051952019370055552000960249253600590258854201650264758800570281265000600286965000480292965000500297765500220302771000610304977001760311085600930328620180917091443.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180912s2018    miu     o     000 0 eng d  a9780472124817q(electronic book)  a9780472901036q(open access)  z9780472131242q(hardcover)  z9780472037384q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.100798902doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU1 aGere, Anne Ruggles,eauthor.10aDeveloping writers in higher education /cAnne Ruggles Gere. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aFor undergraduates following any course of study, it is essential to develop the ability to write effectively. Yet the processes by which students become more capable and ready to meet the challenges of writing for employers, the wider public, and their own purposes remain largely invisible. Developing Writers in Higher Education shows how learning to write for various purposes in multiple disciplines leads college students to new levels of competence. This volume draws on an in-depth study of the writing and experiences of 169 University of Michigan undergraduates, using statistical analysis of 322 surveys, qualitative analysis of 131 interviews, use of corpus linguistics on 94 electronic portfolios and 2,406 pieces of student writing, and case studies of individual students to trace the multiple paths taken by student writers. Topics include student writers' interaction with feedback; perceptions of genre; the role of disciplinary writing; generality and certainty in student writing; students' concepts of voice and style; students' understanding of multimodal and digital writing; high school's influence on college writers; and writing development after college. The digital edition offers samples of student writing, electronic portfolios produced by student writers, transcripts of interviews with students, and explanations of some of the analysis conducted by the contributors. This is an important book for researchers and graduate students in multiple fields. Those in writing studies get an overview of other longitudinal studies as well as key questions currently circulating. For linguists, it demonstrates how corpus linguistics can inform writing studies. Scholars in higher education will gain a new perspective on college student development. The book also adds to current understandings of sociocultural theories of literacy and offers prospective teachers insights into how students learn to write.  aFinally, for high school teachers, this volume will answer questions about college writing.  aSponsored by the Humanities Collaboratory at Michigan.1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 Unported licenseuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aEnglish languagexRhetoricxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aReport writingxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aAcademic writingxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.1 iSupplement (work):aGere, Anne RugglestDeveloping writers in higher educationh1 online resource (appendix with more information about the research, surveys, and program)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1007989001882nam a2200289 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000310012902400300016004000270019010000310021724500530024826400650030130000220036633600260038833700260041433800360044052008290047658800570130565000320136265000230139465500220141771000610143985600920150020180917091655.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180912s2018    miu     o     000 0 eng d  a9780472124664q(electronic book)  z9780472131204q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.98525882doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU0 aIsh-Shalom, Piki,eauthor.10aBeyond the veil of knowledge /cPiki Ish-Shalom. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIs there a need to remodel constructivism to be more politically attuned?¬†Author Piki Ish-Shalom calls for an activist academy that engages society and the polity to prevent the watering down of democracy, while helping to create a space for criticism. In this book, he suggests several concrete measures for this engagement within three spheres: individual theoretical work, the academic community as a whole, and within society and the polity. Beyond the Veil of Knowledge suggests that essentially contested concepts are a key medium that politicians use to try to minimize public resistance to their political goals. For constructivists, this means that the social construction of both social knowledge and the social world can be understood as the sociopolitical construction of knowledge and the sociopolitical world.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aConstructivism (Philosophy) 0aPolitical science. 0aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.985258802394nam a2200289 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000310012902000310016002400300019104000270022110000310024824500930027926400650037230000220043733600260045933700260048533800360051152012960054758800570184365000290190065500220192971000610195185600920201220180912153254.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180912s2018    miu     o     000 0 eng d  a9780472124800q(electronic book)  a9780472074075q(hardcover)  a9780472074075q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.97096592doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU1 aNeumann, Iver B.,eauthor.10aConcepts of international relations, for Students and Other Smarties /cIver B.

Rather than relying on figures or tables, this book piques the reader's interest with a pithy narrative that presents apposite nutshell examples, stresses historical breaks, and throws in the odd pun. Based on Iver B. Neumann's introductory lectures to his students at the London School of Economics, this book is proven in the classroom. In his intimate style, Neumann introduces the long-term historical emergence of concepts such as state (European), state (global), empire, non-state agents, foreign policy, state system, nationalism, globalization, security, international society, great powers, diplomacy, war and peace, balance of power, international law, power and sovereignty, intervention, gender and class. He demonstrates how such phenomena have been understood in different ways over time. First, the reader learns how the use of concepts is an integrated part of politics. Second, the reader sees how social change has worked in the past, and is working now. Third, the book demonstrates how historical and social context matters in ongoing international relations.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aInternational relations. 0aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.970965902547cam  2200373 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000310012902000150016002000390017502000150021402400300022904000270025904900090028605000230029524500920031826400650041030000220047533600260049733700260052333800360054950400510058552011430063658800570177965000440183665000420188065500220192270000410194470000350198571000610202085600920208120180911150412.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180830s2018    miu     ob    001 0 eng    a9780472124350q(electronic book)  z9780472074044q(hardcover)  z0472074040  z9780472054046q(pbk. : alk. paper)  z047205404X7 a10.3998/mpub.93916582doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  aEY2L00aHM851b.A7275 201800aAppified :bculture in the age of apps /cJeremy Wade Morris and Sarah Murray, editors. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aSnapchat.

How do we make sense of how apps like these-and thousands of others-have embedded themselves into our daily routines, permeating the background of ordinary life and standing at-the-ready to be used on our smartphones and tablets? When we look at any single app, it's hard to imagine how such a small piece of software could be particularly notable. But if we look at a collection of them, we see a bigger picture that reveals how the quotidian activities apps encompass are far from banal: connecting with friends (and strangers and enemies), sharing memories (and personally identifying information), making art (and trash), navigating spaces (and reshaping places in the process). While the sheer number of apps is overwhelming, as are the range of activities they address, each one offers an opportunity for us to seek out meaning in the mundane. Appified is the first scholarly volume to examine individual apps within the wider historical and cultural context of media and cultural studies scholarship, attuned to issues of politics and power, identity and the everyday.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aInformation technologyxSocial aspects. 0aApplication softwarexSocial aspects. 4aElectronic books.1 aMorris, Jeremy Wade,d1976-eeditor.1 aMurray, Sarah,d1982-eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.939165803844nam a22003733i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400300015604000270018605000110021324501680022424600600039226400650045226400150051730000580053233600260059033700260061633800360064250400410067850514720071952008830219158800530307465000210312765000260314865500220317470000440319670000380324070000360327871000640331485600920337820180914150035.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180912t20182018miua    ob    000 0 eng d  a9780472124305qelectronic book  z9780472131020qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.99461172doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aJF100504aThe many faces of strategic voting :btactical behavior in electoral systems around the world /cEdited by Laura B.

Often they cast their ballots to prevent a particular outcome, as when their own preferred candidate has no hope of winning and they want to prevent another, undesirable candidate's victory; or, they vote to promote a single-party majority in parliamentary systems, when their own candidate is from a party that has no hope of winning. In their thought-provoking book The Many Faces of Strategic Voting, Laura B. Stephenson, John H. Aldrich, and AndreÃÅ Blais first provide a conceptual framework for understanding why people vote strategically, and what the differences are between sincere and strategic voting behaviors. Expert contributors then explore the many facets of strategic voting through case studies in Great Britain, Spain, Canada, Japan, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and the European Union.  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aVoting research. 0aVotingvCase studies. 4aElectronic books.1 aStephenson, Laura Beth,d1976-eeditor.1 aAldrich, John H.,d1947-eeditor.1 aBlais, AndreÃÅ,d1947-eeditor.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.994611701616nam a22003133i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000290012702400300015604000270018605000160021324500820022926400550031126400100036630000390037633600260041533700260044133800360046750400410050352004630054458800530100760000490106065000660110965500220117571000640119785600410126120180917080811.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180731t20182018miua    ob    000 0 eng    a9780472124084qelectronic book  z9780472130924qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.88791142doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aPN2287.B45604aThe very thought of Herbert Blau /cClark Lunberry and Joseph Roach, editors. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4c√2018  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbn2rdamedia  aonline resourcebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aHerbert Blau spent his entire professional life as both a theater director and theoretician of theater.

Economies of manhood.  aWriting during the reign of emperors Trajan and Hadrian, Juvenal drew on Roman legend and the history of preceding imperial dynasties as a means of scrutinizing cultural upheavals in the Rome of his day. Tacky foreigners, the nouveaux riches, women who don't know their place, bloodthirsty--even crazy--emperors and their (often worse) wives confront the reader at every turn, along with bad poets, corrupt aristocrats, gladiators, whores, false philosophers, sad-sack men in the street, and slaves. Juvenal's poetry set the tone, and often the topics, for satirists throughout the centuries of European literature. In his sixteen verse satires, Juvenal presents speakers who decry the breakdown in traditional Roman values and the status of Roman men as they are confronted by upstart foreigners, devious and deviant women, class traitors, the power of the imperial household, and even the body itself. The satirist castigates vice and immorality even as he revels in describing them. This book locates Juvenal's targets among the matrices of birth, wealth, class, gender, and ethnicity and walks carefully through a number of his most arresting vignettes in order to show not only what, but how, he satirizes. Moreover, the analysis shows that Juvenal's portraits sometimes escape his grasp, and, as often as not, he ends up undermining the voice with which he speaks and the values he claims to hold dear. Individual chapters look at the satirist himself, rebellious bodies, disgraced aristocrats, uppity (even murderous) wives, and the necessary but corrupting power of money. The conclusion considers the endurance of both the targets and the rhetoric behind them in the modern world. Making Men Ridiculous will interest scholars and advanced students of ancient satire, later European satire, imperial Roman culture and literature, and class, gender, and sexuality in the ancient world.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAnxiety in literature. 0aMasculinity in literature. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9779150

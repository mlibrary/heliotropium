Using her own fieldwork as a case study, Berman shows how hands-on work in the arts with learners of all ages and backgrounds can contribute to economic stability by developing new skills, as well as enhancing public health and gender justice within communities. Berman's work, and the community artwork her book documents, present the visual arts as a crucial channel for citizens to find their individual voices and to become agents for change in the arenas of human rights and democracy.1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivativesuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aArt and society. 0aArt and social action. 0aArt and societyzSouth Africa. 0aArt and social actionzSouth Africa.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan) 0aNew public scholarship.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.925631502016nam a22003978i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000400010702000270014702400250017404000180019904300120021705000220022908200170025110000280026824500510029625000170034726400660036430000220043033600260045233700260047833800360050450400510054050505920059158800570118365000470124065000500128765000320133765000350136965000390140465500220144371000610146585600920152620180607000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170411s2017    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a2017011659  a9780472037018q(paper : alk. paper)  a9780472123254q(ebook)7 a10.3998/mpub.9725179  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us---00aRD96.3b.H45 201700a617.1/452231 aHemenway, David,d1945-10aPrivate guns, public health /cDavid Hemenway.  aNew edition. 1a[Ann Arbor, Michigan] :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2017.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aGuns and american society -- The scope of the gun problem -- The facts about gun ownership -- The public health approach -- What public health means in practice -- The scientific basis of injury control -- The wrong medicine : good guys and bad guys -- Gun-related injury and death -- Gun accidents -- Suicides -- Homicides -- Other gun-related crimes -- Self-defense use of guns -- The myth and reality of deterrence -- How common is self-defense gun use? -- Is more better? -- How effective is self-defense gun use? -- Location -- Guns in the home -- Guns in schools -- Guns in public.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aGunshot woundszUnited StatesxPrevention. 0aFirearmsxLaw and legislationzUnited States. 0aGun controlzUnited States. 0aMedical policyzUnited States. 0aFirearms ownershipzUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.972517902631nam  2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000180010702000180012502000180014302400250016104000180018605000230020408200160022724501510024326400540039430000510044833600260049933700260052533800360055150400510058750512020063858800570184065000240189765000220192165000210194365500220196470000340198670000320202070000400205271000610209285600920215320170602163238.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170424s2017    miu      b   s001 0 eng    a2017002263  a9780472053469  a9780472073467  a97804721227697 a10.3998/mpub.9286142  aMiUbengcMiU04aB105.E78bF74 201700a306.4/822300aShowing off, showing up :bstudies of hype, heightened performance, and cultural power /cLaurie Frederik, Kim Marra, Catherine Schuler [editors]. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2017.  a1 online resource (328 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aIntroduction / Laurie Frederik -- Race and Breed: Showing Off "Natural Bodies".

Samuel Barkin and Laura Sjoberg argue that both methods are more widely adaptable than is commonly assumed by either camp. In Interpretive Quantification, ten highly regarded scholars in the field of International Relations apply quantitative methods and formal models to specific constructivist and critical research questions. In this way, each chapter serves not only as evidence that methods can productively be applied across paradigms, but also as a guide as to how this may be done. In sum, the contributors make a compelling case that when researchers cordon off particular methods for merely ideological reasons, they circumscribe their own paradigms and hinder their own research agenda"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aInternational relationsxResearchxMethodology. 0aQuantitative research. 0aConstructivism (Philosophy) 4aElectronic books.1 aBarkin, J.

But are advocates correct that term limits ensure citizens dedicated to the common good--rather than self-serving career politicians--run government? Or does the enforced high rate of turnover undermine the legislature's ability to function? In Implementing Term Limits, Marjorie Sarbaugh-Thompson and Lyke Thompson bring thirteen years of intensive research and 460 interviews to assess changes since Michigan's implementation of term limits in 1993 and explore their implications. Paying special attention to term limits' institutional effects, they also consider legislative representation, political accountability, and the role of the bureaucracy and interest groups in state legislatures. Their thorough study suggests that legislators are less accessible to officials and that there is a larger gap between legislators and their voters. Moreover, legislators become much more politically ambitious after term limits and spend more time on political activities. The selection of top chamber leaders is complicated by newcomers' lack of knowledge about and experience working with the leaders they elect before being sworn in. As a result, term limits in Michigan fail to deliver on many of the "good government" promises that appeal to citizens. Implementing Term Limits makes a unique and valuable contribution to the debate over the best means by which to obtain truly democratic institutions"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aTerm limits (Public office)zMichigan. 0aLegislatorsxTerm of officezMichigan. 0aRepresentative government and representationzMichigan. 0aGovernment accountabilityzMichigan. 0aMichiganxPolitics and government. 4aElectronic books.1 aThompson, Lyke.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aLegislative politics & policy making.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.650573403838nam a2200433 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000440010702000440015102000280019502400250022304000180024804300120026605000240027808200190030224500690032126400540039030000220044433600260046633700260049233800360051849000290055450400510058350509650063452013670159958800570296665000280302365000370305165000310308865000310311965500220315070000260317270000240319871000610322283000290328385600920331220180428000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170616s2017    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a2017011915  a9780472073535q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472053537q(paperback : alk. paper)  a9780472122899q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.9375036  aMiUbengcMiU  aa-ch---00aJQ1538b.T3523 201700a324.95124922304aThe Taiwan voter /cChristopher H.

Achen and T.Y. Wang.  a"The Taiwan Voter examines the critical role ethnic and national identities play in politics, utilizing the case of Taiwan. Although elections there often raise international tensions, and have led to military demonstrations by China, no scholarly books have examined how Taiwan's voters make electoral choices in a dangerous environment. Critiquing the conventional interpretation of politics as an ideological battle between liberals and conservatives, The Taiwan Voter demonstrates in Taiwan the party system and voters' responses are shaped by one powerful determinant of national identity--the China factor. Taiwan's electoral politics draws international scholarly interest because of the prominent role of ethnic and national identification. While in most countries the many tangled strands of competing identities are daunting for scholarly analysis, in Taiwan the cleavages are powerful and limited in number, so the logic of interrelationships among issues, partisanship, and identity are particularly clear. The Taiwan Voter unites experts to investigate the ways in which social identities, policy views, and partisan preferences intersect and influence each other.These novel findings have wide applicability to other countries, and will be of interest to a broad range of social scientists interested in identity politics"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aVoting researchzTaiwan 0aPolitical participationzTaiwan. 0aPolitical partieszTaiwan. 0aIdentity politicszTaiwan. 4aElectronic books.1 aAchen, Christopher H.1 aWang, Te-Yu,d1957-2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aNew comparative politics40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.937503601290cam a2200361 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000310010702000310013802000280016902400240019704000180022105000260023908200160026510000240028124500370030526400540034230000220039633600260041833700260044433800360047049000310050650400510053758800570058860000540064565000240069965500220072371000610074583000310080685600910083720180927092656.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170612s2017    miu     ob   s001 0deng d  a2017012488  a9780472073627q(hardcover)  a9780472053629q(paperback)  a9780472123131q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.351280  aMiUbengcMiU00aPS3573.A798bZ65 201700a812/.542231 aDolan, Jill,d1957-10aWendy Wasserstein /cJill Dolan. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2017.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aMichigan modern dramatists  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aWasserstein, WendyxCriticism and interpretation. 0aFeminist criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aMichigan modern dramatists40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.35128002789cam a22003858i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000300010702000310013702000280016802400250019604000180022105000220023908200170026110000180027824500670029626400540036330000220041733600260043933700260046533800360049149000370052750400510056452014070061558800570202265000420207965000300212165000390215165500220219071000610221283000380227385600920231120180607013511.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170725s2017    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a2017023312  a9780472073634q(hardback)  a9780472053636q(paperback)  a9780472123148q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.9380984  aMiUbengcMiU00aPN1661b.M87 201700a808.2/412231 aMuse, John H.10aMicrodramas :bcrucibles for theater and time /cJohn H.

Muse argues that plays shorter than twenty minutes deserve sustained attention, and that brevity should be considered a distinct mode of theatrical practice. Focusing on artists for whom brevity became both a structural principle and a tool to investigate theater itself (August Strindberg, Maurice Maeterlinck, F. T. Marinetti, Samuel Beckett, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Caryl Churchill), the book explores four episodes in the history of very short theater, all characterized by the self-conscious embrace of brevity. The story moves from the birth of the modernist microdrama in French little theaters in the 1880s, to the explicit worship of speed in Italian Futurist synthetic theater, to Samuel Beckett's often-misunderstood short plays, and finally to a range of contemporary playwrights whose long compilations of shorts offer a new take on momentary theater. Subjecting short plays to extended scrutiny upends assumptions about brief or minimal art, and about theatrical experience. The book shows that short performances often demand greater attention from audiences than plays that unfold more predictably. Microdramas put pressure on preconceptions about which aspects of theater might be fundamentaland about what might qualify as an event. In the process, they suggest answers to crucial questions about time, spectatorship, and significance"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aOne-act playsxHistory and criticism. 0aOne-act playsxTechnique. 0aTheaterxProduction and direction. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aTheater--text/theory/performance.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.938098403161cam a22003858i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000180010702000150012502000180014002000150015802000180017302400250019104000180021605000220023408200240025610000550028024501060033526400540044130000220049533600260051733700260054333800360056950400510060550503160065652014840097258800570245661000620251365000250257565500220260071000610262285600920268320171130085500.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170309s2017    miu      b    001 0 eng c  a2017011110  a9780472073641  a0472073648  a9780472053643  a0472053647  a97804721231627 a10.3998/mpub.7959518  aMiUbengcMiU04aPA3343b.V47 201700a808.80074/774352231 aVerhoogt, A.

The collection was founded in the early part of the 20th century by University of Michigan Professor of Classics Francis W. Kelsey. His original intention was to create a set of artifacts that would be useful in teaching students more directly about the ancient world, at a time when trips to ancient sites were much harder to arrange. Jointly administered by the University of Michigan's Department of Classical Studies and its Library, the collection has garnered significant interest beyond scholarly circles and now sees several hundred visitors each year. Of particular note among the collection's holdings are sixty pages of the earliest known copy of the Epistles of St. Paul, which are often featured on tours of the collection by groups from religious institutions. Arthur Verhoogt, one of the current stewards of the University of Michigan Papyrology Collection, provides clear, insightful information in an appealing style that will attract general readers and scholars alike. Extensively illustrated with some of the collection's more spectacular pieces, this volume describes what the collection is, what kinds of ancient texts it contains, and how it has developed from Francis Kelsey's day to the present.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.20aUniversity of Michigan.bLibrary.bPapyrology Collection. 0aManuscripts (Papyri) 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.795951801685cam a22004218i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000180010702000150012502000180014002000150015802000180017302400250019104000180021605000220023408200160025610000310027224500740030326400540037730000240043133600260045533700260048133800360050749000450054350400510058850502640063958800570090360000340096065000290099465000210102365000240104465500220106871000610109083000200115185600920117120171218144045.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170526s2017    miu      b    001 0 eng    a2017023341  a9780472073733  a0472073737  a9780472053735  a0472053736  a97804721234767 a10.3998/mpub.8504605  aMiUbengcMiU04aHV1568b.T77 201700a362.4012231 aTremain, Shelley,eauthor.10aFoucault and feminist philosophy of disability /cShelley L.

Jewish citizens were active as performers, playwrights, critics, managers, and theatrical shareholders, and often tied their involvement in these endeavors to the patriotic rhetoric of the young republic as they struggled to establish themselves in the new nation. Examining play texts, theatrical reviews, political discourse, and public performances of Jewish rights and rituals, Hideous Characters and Beautiful Pagans argues that Jewish stage types shed light on our understanding of the status of Jewish Americans during a critical historical period. Using an eclectic range of sources including theatrical reviews, diaries, letters, cartoons, portraiture, tax records, rumors flying around the tavern, and more, Heather S. Nathans has listened for the echoes of vanished audiences who witnessed and responded to these stereotypes onstage, from the earliest appearance of Shylock on an American stage in 1752 to Jewish theater artists on the eve of the Civil War. The book integrates social, political, and cultural histories, with an examination of those texts (both dramatic and literary) that shaped the stage Jew"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aTheaterxPolitical aspectszUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aTheater and societyzUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aJewsxIdentityzUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aJews in the theaterzUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.370420603348cam a22004454a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000150011002000270012502000240015202400250017604000180020104300120021905000230023108200150025410000200026924500830028926400640037230000220043633600260045833700260048433800360051049000730054650000350061950000560065450400590071050502050076952014800097458800570245465000690251165100240258065100380260465500220264270000170266471000610268183000680274285600920281020180607005447.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||171006s2017    miu     o      00 0 eng d  a9780472123438  a0472123432  a9780472130627q(print)  a0472130625q(print)7 a10.3998/mpub.8228892  aMiUbengcMiU  ae-it--- 4aDG70.C63bG76 201704a937/.52231 aGrose, David F.14aThe Hellenistic, Roman, and Medieval Glass from Cosa /cDavid Frederick Grose. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2017.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aMemoirs of the American Academy in Rome.

The catalogue.  aThe Hellenistic, Roman, and Medieval Glass from Cosa continues the exemplary record of publication by the American Academy in Rome on important classes of materials recovered in excavation from one of the principal archaeological sites of Roman Italy. Over 15,000 fragments of glass tableware, ranging in date from the mid-second century BCE to the early fifth century CE, were found at Cosa, a small town in Etruria (modern Tuscany). Cosa's products were chiefly exported to North Africa and Europe, but its influence was felt throughout the Mediterranean world. The research and analysis presented here are the work of the late David Frederick Grose, who began this project when no other city site excavations in Italy focused on ancient glass. He confirmed that the Roman glass industry began to emerge in the Julio-Claudian era, beginning in the principate of Augustus. His study traces the evolution of manufacturing techniques from core-formed vessels to free blown glass, and it documents changes in taste and style that were characteristic of the western glass industry throughout its long history. At the time of Grose's unexpected passing, his study was complete but not yet published. Nevertheless, the reputation of his work in this area has done much to establish the value and importance of excavating and researching Cosa's glass. This volume, arranged and edited by R. T. Scott, makes Grose's essential scholarship on the subject available for the first time.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aGlass manufacturezItalyzCosa (Extinct city)xHistoryyTo 1500. 0aItalyxAntiquities. 0aCosa (Extinct city)xAntiquities. 4aElectronic books.1 aScott, R.

This book seeks to expand our view of Brown's work, addressing his practices as a painter and composer as well as his collaborations with visual artists Alexander Calder, Robert Rauschenberg, and the American abstract expressionists. The essays collected here explore Brown's compositional methods and their historical place in depth: not only his influential experiments with open form composition and graphic notation, but his interest in collaboration, mixed media, and his engagement with the European avant-garde. The volume includes several short essays by Brown that shed new light on his relationships with colleagues and the ideas that drove his work.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aBrown, Earle,d1926-2002xCriticism and interpretation. 4aElectronic books.1 aKim, Rebecca Y.1 aBrown, Earle,d1926-2002.tProse works.kSelections.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.968844303015cam a22004218i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000180010702000150012502000180014002000150015802400250017304000180019804300120021605000250022808200150025310000360026824500920030424600310039626400540042730000220048133600260050333700260052933800360055552014830059150400510207458800570212560000530218260000540223560000440228960000470233365000380238065500220241871000610244085600920250120171218131831.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170905s2017    miu      b   s001 0 eng    a2017033408  a9780472130603  a0472130609  a9780472123353  a04721233517 a10.3998/mpub.9373334  aMiUbengcMiU  aa-ja---04aPR4172.W73bP37 201700a823/.82231 aPascoe, Judith,d1960-eauthor.10aOn the bullet train with Emily BronteÃÅ :bWuthering Heights in Japan /cJudith Pascoe.30aWuthering Heights in Japan 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2017.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  a"While teaching in Japan, Judith Pascoe was fascinated to discover the popularity that Emily BronteÃÅ's novel Wuthering Heights has enjoyed there. Nearly 100 years after its first formal introduction to the country, the novel continues to engage the imaginations of Japanese novelists, filmmakers, manga artists and others, resulting in numerous translations, adaptations, and dramatizations. On the Bullet Train with Emily BronteÃÅ is Pascoe's lively account of her quest to discover the reasons for the continuous Japanese embrace of Wuthering Heights, including quite varied and surprising adaptations of the novel. At the same time, the book chronicles Pascoe's experience as an adult student of Japanese. She contemplates the multiple Japanese translations of BronteÃÅ, as contrasted to the single (or non-existent) English translations of major Japanese writers. Carrying out a close reading of a distant country's Wuthering Heights, Pascoe begins to see American literary culture as a small island on which readers are isolated from foreign literature. In this and in her previous book, The Sarah Siddons Audio Files, Pascoe's engaging narrative innovates a new scholarly form involving immersive research practice to attempt a cross-cultural version of reader-response criticism. On the Bullet Train with Emily BronteÃÅ will appeal to scholars in the fields of 19th-century British literature, adaptation studies, and Japanese literary history"--cProvided by publisher.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aBronteÃà, Emily,d1818-1848.tWuthering Heights.10aBronteÃà, Emily,d1818-1848xAppreciationzJapan.10aBronteÃà, Emily,d1818-1848xInfluence.10aBronteÃà, Emily,d1818-1848xAdapatations. 0aReader-response criticismzJapan. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.937333403490nam  22004453i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000350009202000150012702000290014202000150017102400300018604000270021604300120024305000250025510000330028024500910031324600410040426400650044526400100051030000350052033600260055533700260058133800360060749000360064350400510067950502240073052016440095458800570259860000540265565000400270965000310274965100340278065100300281465500220284471000490286683000370291585600920295220180823095332.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||171208s2017    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472123117qelectronic book  a0472123114  z9780472130481qhardcover  z047213048X7 a10.3998/mpub.88463032doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  af-ua--- 4aDT72.C7b.C76 2017eb1 aCromwell, Jennifer,eauthor.10aRecording village life :ba Coptic scribe in early Islamic Egypt /cJennifer Cromwell.30aCoptic scribe in early Islamic Egypt 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017] 4c√2017  a1 online resource (225 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aNew texts from ancient cultures  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aA scribe in his time and place -- Building Aristophanes' dossier -- Putting pen on papyrus: scribal practices and processes -- Recording taxes -- Recording private lives -- Aristophanes' personal and professional lives.  aRecording Village Life presents a close study of over 140 Coptic texts written between 724-756 CE by a single scribe, Aristophanes son of Johannes, of the village Djeme in western Thebes. These texts, which focus primarily on taxation and property concerns, yield a wealth of knowledge about social and economic changes happening at both the community and country-wide levels during the early years of Islamic rule in Egypt. Additionally, they offer a fascinating picture of the scribe's role within this world, illuminating both the practical aspects of his work and the social and professional connections with clients for whom he wrote legal documents. Papyrological analysis of Aristophanes' documents, within the context of the textual record of the village, shows a new and divergent scribal practice that reflects broader trends among his contemporaries: Aristophanes was part of a larger, national system of administrative changes, enacted by the country's Arab rulers in order to better control administrative practices and fiscal policies within the country. Yet Aristophanes' dossier shows him not just as an administrator, revealing details about his life, his role in the community, and the elite networks within which he operated. This unique perspective provides new insights into both the micro-history of an individual's experience of eighth-century Theban village life, and its reflection in the macro social, economic, and political trends in Egypt at this time. This book will prove valuable to scholars of late antique studies, papyrology, philology, early Islamic history, social and economic history, and Egyptology.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.00aAristophanesc(Son of Johannes),dactive 724-756. 0aScribeszEgyptzJeme (Extinct city) 0aCoptszJeme (Extinct city) 0aJeme (Extinct city)xHistory. 0aEgyptxHistoryy640-1250. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan) 0aNew texts from ancient cultures.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.884630301142nam a22003137i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000150009202000180010702000180012502000180014302400250016104000180018610000310020424500800023526400550031526400100037030000550038033600260043533700260046133800360048758800570052365000400058065000330062065500220065371000610067585600920073620180324151442.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170208t20172017miua          ||| ||eng d  a0472053485  a9780472122783  z9780472053483  z97804720734817 a10.3998/mpub.9479376  aMiUbengcMiU1 aCoppa, Francesca,eauthor.14aThe fanfiction reader :bfolk tales for the digital age /cFrancesca Coppa. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017] 4c√2017  a1 online resource (xi, 285 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aFan fictionxHistory and criticism. 0aLiterature and the Internet. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.947937601466cam a2200361 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000150009202000180010702000180012502000150014302400250015804000180018304300120020105000240021310000290023724501400026626400550040630000760046133600260053733700260056333800360058950400670062558800570069261000540074965000520080365000440085565500220089970000300092171000610095185600920101220171130093344.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170706s2017    miuach   b    001 0 eng d  a0472130617  a9780472130610  a9780472123421  a04721234247 a10.3998/mpub.9706456  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us-mi 4aR747.U6834bB6 20171 aBoster, Dea H.,eauthor.10aMedicine at Michigan :ba history of the University of Michigan Medical School at the bicentennial /cDea H.

Throughout the book, Flory focuses on the central importance of "crossover" to the Motown story; first as a key concept in the company's efforts to reach across American commercial markets, then as a means to extend influence internationally, and finally as a way to expand the brand beyond strictly musical products. Flory's work reveals the richness of the Motown sound, and equally rich and complex cultural influence Motown still exerts.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aRhythm and blues musicxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aTracking pop40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.32208002693pam a2200433 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000180010702000150012502000180014002000150015802000180017302400250019104000180021604300120023405000220024608200200026824501420028824600260043026400550045626400100051130000400052133600260056133700260058733800360061350400510064952011810070058800570188165000360193865000440197465000220201865500220204070000220206270000220208471000610210685600920216720170502043400.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170210t20172017miu      b   s001 0 eng    a2016046545  a9780472053360  a0472053361  a9780472073368  a0472073362  a97804721226087 a10.3998/mpub.9286618  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us---04aPN2189b.S59 201700a792.090904622304aThe sixties, center stage :bmainstream and popular performances in a turbulent decade /cedited by James M.

While much critical attention has been focused on experimental and radical theater of the period, the essays confirm that mainstream performances not only merit more scholarly attention than they have received, but through serious examination provide an important key to understanding the 1960s as a period. The introduction provides a broad overview of the social, political, and cultural contexts of artistic practices in mainstream theater from the mid-fifties to mid-seventies. Readers will find detailed examinations of the mainstream's surprising attention to craft and innovation; to the rich exchange between European and American theatres; to the rise of regional theaters; and finally, to popular cultural performances that pushed the conceptual boundaries of mainstream institutions. The book looks afresh at productions of Hair, Cabaret, Raisin in the Sun, and Fiddler on the Roof, as well as German theater, and performances outside the Democratic National Convention of 1968"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aTheaterxHistoryy20th century. 0aPopular culturexHistoryy20th century. 0aNineteen sixties. 4aElectronic books.1 aHarding, James M.1 aRosenthal, Cindy.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.928661802072cam a2200409 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000390010702000440014602000280019002400250021804000180024304300120026105000270027308200240030010000260032424500830035026400550043330000220048833600260051033700260053633800360056249000390059850400510063750504890068858800570117765000580123465000470129265000480133965000610138765500220144871000610147083000390153185600920157020180427224845.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||161006s2017    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a2016031596  a9780472053377q(pbk. : alk. paper)  a9780472073375q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472122615q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.9332315  aMiUbengcMiU  aa-ko---00aHN730.5.Z9bI5646 201700a303.48/330951952231 aJin, Dal Yong,d1964-10aSmartland Korea :bmobile communication, culture, and society /cDal Yong Jin. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aPerspectives on contemporary Korea  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aThe rise of smartland Korea -- Evolution of smartphone technologies: putting smarts into the phone -- Neoliberal transformation of the mobile telecommunications systems -- Mobile communication, globalization, and technological hegemony -- App economy in the digital platform era -- From digital divide to digital inclusion in the smartphone era -- Transformative mobile game culture on the smartphone -- Reimagining smartphones: Kakao Talk and youth culture -- Beyond smartland Korea.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aInformation technologyxSocial aspectszKorea (South) 0aSmartphonesxSocial aspectszKorea (South) 0aMobile communication systemszKorea (South) 0aTechnological innovationsxSocial aspectszKorea (South) 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aPerspectives on contemporary Korea40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.933231503376cam a2200421 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000470010702000470015402000350020102400250023604000180026104300120027905000240029108200280031510000280034324501040037126400550047530000220053033600260055233700260057833800360060449000610064050400510070150502040075252015170095658800570247365000580253065000530258865000290264165100480267065500220271871000610274083000610280185600920286220180804165114.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||161007s2017    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a2016046421  a9780472053407qpaperback ;qalkaline paper  a9780472073405qhardcover ;qalkaline paper  a9780472122660qelectronic book7 a10.3998/mpub.9416956  aMiUbengcMiU  ae-gx---00aML3918.G3bW57 201700a306.4/84250943090422231 aWipplinger, Jonathan O.14aThe jazz republic :bmusic, race, and American culture in Weimar Germany /cJonathan O.

Jonathan O. Wipplinger explores the history of jazz in Germany as well as the roles that music, race (especially Blackness), and America played in German culture and follows the debate over jazz through the fourteen years of Germany's first democracy. He explores visiting jazz musicians including the African American Sam Wooding and the white American Paul Whiteman and how their performances were received by German critics and artists. He also engages with the meaning of jazz in debates over changing gender norms and jazz's status between paradigms of high and low culture. By looking at German translations of Langston Hughes's poetry, as well as Theodor W. Adorno's controversial rejection of jazz in light of racial persecution, Wipplinger examines how jazz came to be part of German cultural production more broadly in both the US and Germany, in the early 1930s. Using a wide array of sources from newspapers, modernist and popular journals, as well as items from the music press, this work intervenes in the debate over the German encounter with jazz by arguing that the music was no mere "symbol" of Weimar's modernism and modernity. Rather than reflecting intra-German and/or European debates, it suggests that jazz and its practitioners, African American, white American, Afro-European, German and otherwise, shaped Weimar culture in a central way.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aJazzxSocial aspectszGermanyxHistoryy20th century. 0aJazzzGermanyy1921-1930xHistory and criticism. 0aMusic and racezGermany. 0aGermanyxCivilizationxAmerican influences. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.941695602337cam a2200421 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000490010702000490015602000280020502400250023304000180025805000250027608200190030110000230032024000230034324501080036626400550047430000220052933600260055133700260057733800360060349000200063950400410065952008210070058800570152160000350157865000470161365000240166065000130168465500220169770000230171971000610174283000200180385600920182320180607000825.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170202s2017    miu     ob   s000 0deng d  a2016046277  a9780472053445q(paperback : acid-free paper)  a9780472073443q(hardcover : acid-free paper)  a9780472122745q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.9462628  aMiUbengcMiU00aPS3561.O455bA6 201700a811/.54aB2231 aKomunyakaa, Yusef.10aWorks.kSelections10aCondition red :bessays, interviews, and commentaries /cYusef Komunyakaa ; edited by Radiclani Clytus. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aPoets on poetry  aIncludes bibliographical references.  a"Condition Red collects writing by one of America's most gifted and revered poets, Yusef Komunyakaa.

Condition Red includes his powerful letter to Poetry magazine, asserting that "we writers (artists) cannot forget that we are responsible for what we conjure and embrace through language, whether in essays, novels, plays, poems, or songs." Also included are essays and interviews on:coming home to Bogalusa, Louisiana; the influence of religion on black poetry; language and eroticism; the visual artist Floyd Tunson; and the poets Robert Hayden, Walt Whitman, Clarence Major, and Etheridge Knight."--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aKomunyakaa, YusefvInterviews. 0aPoets, Americany20th centuryvInterviews. 0aPoetryxAuthorship. 0aPoetics. 4aElectronic books.1 aClytus, Radiclani.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aPoets on poetry40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.946262801618cam a2200397 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000440010702000490015102000280020002400250022804000180025305000190027108200160029010000200030624501040032626400550043030000220048533600260050733700260053333800360055949000310059550400670062650501580069358800570085165000320090865000290094065000250096965000200099465500220101471000610103683000310109785600920112820180607001443.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170603s2017    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a2017011931  a9780472053544q(pbk. : acid-free paper)  a9780472073542q(hardcover : acid-free paper)  a9780472122936q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.9311549  aMiUbengcMiU00aAM7b.D68 201700a069/.682231 aDouglas, Stacy.10aCurating community :bmuseums, constitutionalism, and the taming of the political /cStacy Douglas. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aLaw, meaning, and violence  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 167-193) and index.0 aConstituting the political -- Sovereign orientations -- The time of sovereignty -- Monumental politics -- Toward a less constitutional constitutionalism.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aMuseumsxPolitical aspects. 0aMuseumsxSocial aspects. 0aMuseumsxPhilosophy. 0aCommunity life. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aLaw, meaning, and violence40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.931154903332pam a2200409 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000170009202000180010902000150012702000180014202000150016002000180017502400250019304000180021804300120023605000220024808200190027010000390028924501120032824600340044026400590047426400100053330000550054333600260059833700260062433800360065050400670068650505620075352013380131558800570265365000370271065500220274771000610276985600920283020180905043600.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170629t20172017miua     b    001 0deng    a  2017012623  a9780472053599  a0472053590  a9780472073597  a0472073591  a97804721230567 a10.3998/mpub.9518889  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us---04aCT3260b.B88 201700a920.7209732231 aBuss, Fran Leeper,d1942-eauthor.10aMemory, meaning, and resistance :breflecting on oral history and women at the margins /cFran Leeper Buss.14aMemory, meaning, & resistance 1aAnn Arbor, MI :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017] 4c√2017  a1 online resource (xv, 210 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 187-205) and index.0 aAcknowledgments -- Preface -- Introduction -- Situated locations : "eight girls, trying to have a boy" -- Agency : "God gave you a big mouth" -- Memory construction : "since Daddy made God die" -- Interrelationships : "the Third Testament" -- Meaning : "the footprints of our lives" -- Knowledge from below : "we left our berries to rot" -- Activism and social movements : "a brown Statue of Liberty" -- Activism and spirituality : "like a conversion" -- Conclusion -- Epilogue -- Appendix: profiles of the women mentioned -- Notes -- Bibliography -- Index.8 a"Fran Leeper Buss, a former welfare recipient who earned a PhD in history and became a pioneer in the field of oral history, has for forty years dedicated herself to the goal of collecting the stories of marginal and working-class U.S. women. Memory, Meaning, and Resistance is based on over 100 oral histories gathered from women from a variety of racial, ethnic, and geographical backgrounds, including a traditional Mexican American midwife, a Latina poet and organizer for the United Farm Workers, and an African American union and freedom movement organizer. Buss now analyzes this body of work, identifying common themes in women's lives and resistance that unite the oral histories she has gathered. From the beginning, her work has shed light on the inseparable, compounding effects of gender, race, ethnicity, and class on women's lives-what is now commonly called intersectionality. Memory, Meaning, and Resistance is structured thematically, with each chapter analyzing a concept that runs through the oral histories, e.g., agency, activism, religion. The result is a testament to women's individual and collective strength, and an invaluable guide for students and researchers, on how to effectively and sensitively conduct oral histories that observe, record, recount, and analyze women's life stories"--Page 4 of cover.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aWomenzUnited StatesvBiography. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.951888901435nam a2200397 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000310010702000310013802000280016902400250019704000180022204300120024005000220025208200160027410000170029024500880030726400550039530000220045033600260047233700260049833800360052449000270056050400670058758800570065465000210071165000270073265000350075965000410079465500220083571000610085783000270091885600920094520180713000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170623s2017    miuaf   ob   s001 0 eng d  a2017030458  a9780472053667q(paperback)  a9780472073665q(hardcover)  a9780472123315q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.9256315  aMiUbengcMiU  af-sa---00aN72.S6bB475 201700a701/.032231 aBerman, Kim.10aFinding voice :ba visual arts approach to engaging social change /cKim S.

Made accessible in English by the expertise of translators Anthony H. Chambers and Paul McCarthy, the stories in The Gourmet Club vividly explore an array of human passions. In "The Children," three mischievous friends play sadomasochistic games in a mysterious Western-style mansion. The sybaritic narrator of "The Secret" experiments with cross-dressing as he savors the delights of duplicity. "The Two Acolytes" evokes the conflicting attractions of spiritual fulfillment and worldly pleasure in medieval Kyoto. In the title story, the seductive tastes, aromas, and textures of outlandish Chinese dishes blend with those of the seductive hands that proffer them to blindfolded gourmets. In "Mr. Bluemound," Tanizaki, who wrote for a film studio in the early 1920s, considers the relationship between a flesh-and-blood actress and her image fixed on celluloid, which one memorably degenerate admirer is obsessed with. And, finally, "Manganese Dioxide Dreams" offers a tantalizing insight into the author's mind as he weaves together the musings of an old man very like Tanizaki himself-Chinese and Japanese cuisine, a French murder movie, Chinese history, and the contents of a toilet bowl. These beautifully translated stories will intrigue and entertain readers who are new to Tanizaki, as well as those who have already explored the bizarre world of his imagination"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 4aElectronic books.1 aChambers, Anthony H.q(Anthony Hood)1 aMcCarthy, Paul,d1944-2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aMichigan monograph series in Japanese studies ;40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.940918901339cam a2200349 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000440010702000390015102000280019002400250021804000180024305000220026108200160028310000230029924500880032226400550041030000220046533600260048733700260051333800360053949000560057550400510063158800570068265000360073965500220077571000610079783000390085885600920089720180804163515.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||161129s2017    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a2016045005  a9780472073412q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472053414q(pbk. : alk. paper)  a9780472122684q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.7484138  aMiUbengcMiU00aJZ5538b.G64 201700a303.6/62231 aGoetze, Catherine.14aThe distinction of peace :ba social analysis of peacebuilding /cCatherine Goetze. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aConfigurations : critical studies of world politics  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPeace-buildingxSocial aspects. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aConfigurations (Ann Arbor, Mich.).40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.748413802501cam a22004218i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000180010702000150012502000180014002000150015802000180017302400250019104000180021604300120023405000240024608200170027010000340028724501480032125000190046926400550048826400100054330000560055333600260060933700260063533800360066149000280069752009950072550400510172058800570177165000480182865500220187671000610189883000280195985600920198720170905154726.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||161213t20172017miua     b    001 0 eng    a2016054030  a9780472073450  a0472073451  a9780472053452  a0472053450  a97804721227527 a10.3998/mpub.9476502  aMiUbengcMiU  an------04aQL719.A14bK87 201700a599.09772231 aKurta, Allen,d1952-eauthor.10aMammals of the Great Lakes region /cAllen Kurta ; drawings by Scott A.

The Great Lakes region is home to 83 species, ranging from tiny shrews that weigh less than a tenth of an ounce to immense moose, known to exceed a half ton. Now in its 60th year in print, Mammals of the Great Lakes Region is the must-have reference guide for teachers, students, naturalists, and professional biologists interested in these animals.

It begins with chords, their functions and characteristic hierarchies, then identifies the most common and salient harmonic-progression classes, or harmonic schemas. The identification of these schemas, as well as the historical contextualization of many of them, allows for systematic exploration of the repertory's typical harmonic transformations (such as chord substitution) and harmonic ambiguities. Doll provides readers with a novel explanation of the assorted aural qualities of chords, and how certain harmonic effects result from the interaction of various melodic, rhythmic, textural, timbral, and extra-musical contexts, and how these interactions can determine whether a chordal riff is tonally centered or tonally ambiguous, whether it sounds aggressive or playful or sad, whether it seems to evoke an earlier song using a similar series of chords, whether it sounds conventional or unfamiliar.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aRock musicxAnalysis, appreciation. 0aHarmony. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aTracking pop.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.307929501853cam a2200445 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000310010702000310013802000280016902400250019704000180022204300120024005000260025208200160027810000220029424501520031626400550046830000220052333600260054533700260057133800360059749000640063350400670069758800570076460000510082160000320087260000430090460000450094760000460099265000320103865000490107065000490111965500220116871000610119083000640125185600920131520180927090925.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170606s2017    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a2017011932  a9780472073559q(hardcover)  a9780472053551q(paperback)  a9780472122950q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.6706550  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us---00aPS3562.U258bZ34 201700a812/.542231 aEdgecomb, Sean F.10aCharles Ludlam lives! :bCharles Busch, Bradford Louryk, Taylor Mac, and the queer legacy of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company /cSean F.

In the process, he established himself as one of the most prominent and socially engaged film artists in postwar Japan. Imbued with vibrant social realism and astute political commentary, his filmic genres ranged widely from melodramas, period films from the Tokugawa era, samurai action jidaigeki, social satires, and antiwar films. Providing serious insights into and trenchant critique of the moral corruption in Japanese politics, academe, industry, and society, Yamamoto at the same time produced highly successful films that offered drama and entertainment for Japanese and international moviegoers. His considerable artistic distinction, strong social and political consciousness, and filmic versatility have earned him a unique and distinguished position among Japan's world-class film directors. In addition to detailed annotations of the autobiography, translator Chia-ning Chang offers a comprehensive introduction to the career and the significance of Yamamoto and his works in the context of Japanese film history. It contextualizes Yamamoto's life and works in the historical and cultural zeitgeist of prewar, wartime, and postwar Japan before scrutinizing the unique qualities of his narrative voice and social conscience as a film artist.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aYamamoto, Satsuo,d1910-1983. 0aMotion picture producers and directorszJapanvBiography. 4aElectronic books.1 aChang, Chia-ning.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aMichigan monograph series in japanese studies ;40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.930634704352cam a22004214a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000150011002000270012502000240015202400250017604000180020104300120021905000230023108200170025410000180027124501080028926400660039730000220046333600260048533700260051133800360053749000250057350000560059850400670065450511850072152016630190658800570356965100340362665500220366070000200368270000190370271000610372183000560378285600920383820180607025403.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170403s2017    miu     o      00 0 eng d  a9780472122554  a047212255X  a9780472073344q(print)  a0472073346q(print)7 a10.3998/mpub.9200634  aMiUbengcMiU  af-sa--- 4aDT1776b.W588 201704a968.00722231 aWitz, Leslie.10aUnsettled history :bmaking South African public pasts /cLeslie Witz, Gary Minkley, and Ciraj Rassool. 1aAnn Arbor [Michigan] :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aAfrican perspectives  aIssued as part of book collections on Project MUSE.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 274-304) and index.0 aThe troika : a preface -- 1.

Heritage and the post-antiapartheid / Gary Minkley, Leslie Witz, and Ciraj Rassool.  aUnsettled History examines South African society and the construction and presentation of its public pasts, from Nelson Mandela's release from prison in 1990 to South Africa's hosting of the 2010 FIFA World Cup . Conventionally represented as a time of rectifying the silences and distortions of settler history through inclusion and recovery, the focus here instead is on the shifts in processes and locations of historicizing and the unsettled state of categories of framing history in post-apartheid South Africa. This era saw fundamental transformations in the order of knowledge: from the academy to the public; from popular history to public history; from history-as-lesson to history-as-forum. Leslie Witz, Gary Minkley, and Ciraj Rassool take the reader to sites of historical production in which complex ideas about pasts are invoked, and navigate a path toward understanding the agencies of image-making and memory production. This volume is the outcome of the authors' intensive collaborative research and engagement over twenty-five years on questions including the production and performance of apartheid history; the cultural politics of social history; South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission and practices of orality; tourism as an arena of image-making and historical construction; museums as sites of heritage production for a new South Africa; photographs, archival meanings, and the construction of the social documentary; and the centenary commemorations of the South African War and the making of race. The authors not only witnessed many of these instances of history-making but were also participants in their constitution.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aSouth AfricaxHistoriography. 4aElectronic books.1 aRassool, Ciraj.1 aMinkley, Gary.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aAfrican perspectives (University of Michigan Press)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.920063401281nam a22003373i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000180011002000180012802400250014604000180017110000390018924500950022825000210032326400550034426400100039930000570040933600260046633700260049233800360051849000280055458800570058265000490063965000510068865500220073971000610076183000290082285600920085120170920120332.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170602t20172017miua          000 0 eng d  a9780472122639  z9780472053384  z97804720733827 a10.3998/mpub.8158052  aMiUbengcMiU1 aHarding, James H.,d1949-eauthor.10aAmphibians and reptiles of the Great Lakes Region /cJames H.

It opens with Nina Berman's iconic photograph Marine Wedding, which provoked a debate about the medical, military, and psychological response to serious combat injuries. While these issues remain urgent, it is equally crucial to interrogate the representation of war and injury. The concepts of valor, heroism, patriotism, and courage assume visible form and do their cultural work when they are personified and embodied. The mutilated or disabled veteran's body can connote the brutalizing, dehumanizing potential of modern combat. Suzannah Biernoff draws on a wide variety of sources mainly from WWI but also contemporary photography and computer games. Each chapter revolves around particular images: Marine Wedding is discussed alongside Stuart Griffiths' portraits of British veterans; Henry Tonks' drawings of WWI facial casualties are compared to the medical photographs in the Gillies Archives; the production of portrait masks for the severely disfigured is approached through the lens of documentary film and photography; and finally the haunting image of one of Tonks's patients reappears in BioShock, a highly successful computer game. The book simultaneously addresses a neglected area in disability studies; puts disfigurement on the agenda for art history and visual studies; and makes a timely and provocative contribution to the literature on the First World War.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aSurgery, Plastic. 0aDisfigured personsxTreatment. 0aDisabled veteransxRehabilitation. 0aTheatrical prosthetic makeup. 0aProsthesisvCase studies. 0aWar woundsxTreatment. 0aMutilationxTreatment. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aCorporealities.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.713213803278nam a22004094a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000150011002000270012502000240015202400250017604000180020105000270021908200150024610000290026124000240029024500780031426400660039230000220045833600260048033700260050633800360053249000200056850000560058850400670064450502530071152015820096458800570254665000350260365000350263865500220267371000610269583000200275685600920277620180807194000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||171117s2017    miu     o      00 0 eng d  a9780472122776  a0472122770  a9780472073474q(print)  a0472073478q(print)7 a10.3998/mpub.9478071  aMiUbengcMiU 4aPS3552.O75645bA6 201704a811/.62231 aBoruch, Marianne,d1950-10aEssays.kSelections14aThe Little Death of Self :bNine Essays toward Poetry /cMarianne Boruch. 1aAnn Arbor [Michigan] :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aPoets on poetry  aIssued as part of book collections on Project MUSE.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 169-174) and index.0 aTo warn and to acknowledge -- The end inside it -- Seeing things -- Is and was -- Heavy lifting -- O'Connor plus Bishop plus closely plus distance -- Charm -- Diagnosis, poetry, and the burden of mystery -- Three Blakes -- The little death of self.  aA volume in the Poets on Poetry series, which collects critical works by contemporary poets, gathering together the articles, interviews, and book reviews by which they have articulated the poetics of a new generation. The line between poetry (the delicate, surprising not-quite) and the essay (the emphatic so-there!) is thin, easily crossed. Both welcome a deep mulling-over, endlessly mixing image and idea and running with scissors; certainly each distrusts the notion of premise or formulaic progression. Marianne Boruch's essays in The Little Death of Self emerged by way of odd details or bothersome questions that would not quit--Why does the self grow smaller as the poem grows enormous? Why does closure in a poem so often mean keep going? Must we stalk the poem or does the poem stalk us until the world clicks open? Boruch's intrepid curiosity led her to explore fields of expertise about which she knew little: aviation, music, anatomy, history, medicine, photography, fiction, neuroscience, physics, anthropology, painting, and drawing. There's an addiction to metaphor here, an affection for image, sudden turns of thinking, and the great subjects of poetry: love, death, time, knowledge. There's amazement at the dumb luck of staying long enough in an inkling to make it a poem at all. Poets such as Keats, Stevens, Frost, Plath, Auden, and Bishop, along with painters, inventors, doctors, scientists, composers, musicians, neighbors, friends, and family--all traffic blatantly or under the surface--and one gets a glimpse of such fellow travelers now and then.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPoetryxHistory and criticism. 0aAmerican essaysy21st century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aPoets on poetry40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.947807105058cam a22003854a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000150011002000270012502000240015202400250017604000180020105000280021924500900024726400660033730000220040333600260042533700260045133800360047749000210051350000560053450400410059050519380063152017270256958800570429660000640435365000360441765500220445370000230447571000610449883000210455985600920458020180607012634.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170426s2017    miu     o      00 0 eng d  a9780472122820  a0472122827  a9780472073504q(print)  a0472073508q(print)7 a10.3998/mpub.9493485  aMiUbengcMiU 4aPR9499.3.A39bZ735 201700aMad heart be brave :bessays on the poetry of Agha Shahid Ali /cedited by Kazim Ali. 1aAnn Arbor [Michigan] :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aUnder discussion  aIssued as part of book collections on Project MUSE.  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aIntroduction / Kazim Ali -- The world is full of paper.

Mad Heart Be Brave: On the Poetry of Agha Shahid Ali is the first comprehensive examination of all stages of his career, from his earliest work published in India but never reissued in the U.S., through his seven poetry volumes from American publishers, ultimately collected as The Veiled Suite. The essays, written by a range of poets and scholars, many of whom knew and studied with Ali, consider his early free verse poetry; his transition into writing more formalist poetry; his correspondence with poets Anthony Hecht and James Merrill; his literary engagement with the political realities of contemporary Kashmir; his teaching and mentorship of young poets; and Ali's championing of the ghazal, a traditional Eastern poetic form, in English. Some essays have a predominantly scholarly focus, while others are more personal in their tone and content. All exhibit a deep appreciation for Ali's life and work. Contributors to this volume include Sejal Shah, Rita Banerjee, Amanda Golden, Ravi Shankar, Abin Chakraborty, Amy Newman, Christopher Merrill, Jason Schneiderman, Stephen Burt, Raza Ali Hassan, Syed Humayoun, Feroz Rather, Dur e Aziz Amna, Mihaela Moscaliuc, Reginald Dwayne Betts, Mahwash Shoaib, Shadab Zeest Hashmi, Grace Schulman, and Ada Lim on. Mad Heart Be Brave closes with a long biographical sketch and elegy by Agha Shahid Ali's friend Amitav Ghosh and a comprehensive bibliography assembled by scholar Patricia O'Neill with Reid Larson.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aAgha, Shahid Ali,d1949-2001xCriticism and interpretation. 0aGhazalsxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.1 aAli, Kazim,d1971-2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aUnder discussion40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.949348504636nam a22004214a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000240011002400250013404000180015904300120017705000220018908200160021124500970022726400660032430000220039033600260041233700260043833800360046449000600050050000560056050400510061650517110066752013680237858800570374660000360380365000420383965000160388165500220389770000260391970000210394570000350396671000610400183000600406285600920412220180807194000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||171201s2017    miu     o      00 0 eng d  a9780472122851  a0472122851q(print)7 a10.3998/mpub.9238370  aMiUbengcMiU  ae-gx--- 4aN6868b.N687 201704a700.41122300aNot Straight from Germany /cMichael Thomas Taylor, Annette Timm, and Rainer Herrn, editors. 1aAnn Arbor [Michigan] :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aSocial history, popular culture and politics in Germany  aIssued as part of book collections on Project MUSE.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aintroduction : sexual publics and sexual citizenship from Hirschfeld to the present / Annette F.

Heineman.  aMagnus Hirschfeld's Institute for Sexual Science was founded in Berlin in 1919 as a place of research, political advocacy, counseling, and public education. Inspired by the world's first gay rights organizations, it was closely allied with other groups fighting for sexual reform and women's rights, and was destroyed in 1933 as the first target of the Nazi book burnings. Not Straight from Germany examines the legacy of that history, combining essays and a lavish array of visual materials. Scholarly essays investigate the ways in which sex became public in early 20th-century Germany, contributing to a growing awareness of Hirschfeld's influence on histories of sexuality while also widening the perspective beyond the lens of identity politics. Two visual sourcebooks and catalog essays on an exhibition of contemporary artists' responses to the Hirschfeld historical materials interrogate the modes of visual representation that Hirschfeld employed by re-imagining the public visibility of his institute from a contemporary perspective. The archival material includes stunning, never-before-published images from Hirschfeld's institute that challenge many received ideas, while the scholarly and art catalog essays explore collaboration and dialogue as methods of research and activism that resonate beyond the academy to pressing issues of public concern.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aHirschfeld, Magnus,d1868-1935. 0aArtszGermanyxHistoryy20th century. 0aSex in art. 4aElectronic books.1 aHerrn, Rainer,d1957-1 aTimm, Annette F.1 aTaylor, Michael Thomas,d1977-2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aSocial history, popular culture and politics in Germany40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.923837002908nam a22003494a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000240011002400250013404000180015904300120017705000310018908200180022010000240023824500690026226400660033130000220039733600260041933700260044533800360047150000560050750400510056350503230061452013380093758800570227565000510233265500220238371000610240585600920246620180807194300.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180109r20182017miu     o      00 0 eng d  a9780472122905  a0472122908q(print)7 a10.3998/mpub.9513543  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us-mi 4aLD3278b.M39 2015eb pt. .204a378.1/9612231 aMayer, Frederick W.12aSetting For Excellence, Part IInPart II :.cFrederick W.

Epilogue : the effectiveness of planning.  aCampus planning is often a crucial underlying set of goals for university administrations, even if, over time, the mix of new and old buildings, changes in usage patterns and activities of students, and evolution of styles present challenges to a cohesive campus plan. In its two-hundred year history the University of Michigan has planned its campus in waves, from the earliest days of the iconic buildings around the Diag to the plans for the hospitals and the North Campus. This immensely informative and entertaining second volume in the history of the evolution of the campuses offers an absorbing narrative from the perspective of Fred Mayer, who served for more than three decades as the campus planner for the university during an important period of its growth during the late twentieth century. By tracing the development of the Ann Arbor campus from its early days to the present, within the context of the evolution of higher education in America, Mayer provides a strong argument for the importance of rigorous and enlightened campus planning as a critical element of the learning environment of the university. His comprehensive history of campus planning, illustrated with photos, maps, and diagrams from Michigan's history, is an outstanding contribution to the university's history as it approaches its bicentennial.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aCampus planningzMichiganzAnn ArborxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.951354303355cam a22003974a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000270011002400250013704000180016204300120018005000250019210000340021724500540025126400660030530000220037133600260039333700260041933800360044549000370048150000560051850400670057450507250064152010940136658800570246065000430251765000740256065000550263465000550268965500220274471000610276683000380282785600920286520180607020030.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170915s2017    miu     o      00 0 eng d  a9780472123063  a9780472073603q(print)7 a10.3998/mpub.9509783  aMiUbengcMiU  an-cn-on 4aPN2306.T6bK667 20171 aKnowles, Richard Paul,d1950-10aPerforming the Intercultural City /cRic Knowles. 1aAnn Arbor [Michigan] :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aTheater: theory/text/performance  aIssued as part of book collections on Project MUSE.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 243-260) and index.0 aIntroduction -- part one.

Performing the Intercultural City explores how Toronto--a representative global city in this multicultural country--stages diversity through its many intercultural theater companies and troupes. The book begins with a theoretical introduction to theatrical interculturalism. Subsequent chapters outline the historical and political context within which intercultural performance takes place; examine the ways in which Indigenous, Filipino, and Afro-Caribbean Canadian theater has developed play structures based on culturally specific forms of expression; and explore the ways that intercultural companies have used intermediality, modernist form, and intercultural discourse to mediate across cultures. Performing the Intercultural City will appeal to scholars, artists, and the theater-going public, including those in theater and performance studies, urban studies, critical multiculturalism studies, diaspora studies, critical cosmopolitanism studies, critical race theory, and cultural studies.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aTheater and societyzOntariozToronto. 0aIntercultural communication in the performing artszOntariozToronto. 0aPerforming artsxSocial aspectszOntariozToronto. 0aMulticulturalism in the theaterzOntariozToronto. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aTheater--text/theory/performance.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.950978303886nam a22003374a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202400250011004000180013505000280015310000270018124500630020826400660027130000220033733600260035933700260038533800360041149000200044750000560046750400410052350510740056452015960163858800570323465000620329165500220335371000610337583000200343685600920345620180606222800.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170921s2017    miu     o      00 0 eng d  a97804721231937 a10.3998/mpub.9718871  aMiUbengcMiU 4aPS3557.O4695bP588 20171 aGonzaÃÅlez, Rigoberto.10aPivotal Voices, Era of Transition /cRigoberto GonzaÃÅlez. 1aAnn Arbor [Michigan] :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aPoets on poetry  aIssued as part of book collections on Project MUSE.  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aCritical essays -- Latino poetry : pivotal voices, era of transition -- Alurista : toward a Chicano poetics -- The twenty-first-century queer Chicano poetics of Eduardo C.

AlarcoÃÅn and his muse, Federico GarciÃÅa Lorca.  aPivotal Voices, Era of Transition gathers Rigoberto GonzaÃÅlez's most important essays and book reviews, many of which consider the work of emerging poets whose identities and political positions are transforming what readers expect from contemporary poetry. A number of these voices represent intersectional communities, such as queer writers of color like Natalie DiÃÅaz, Danez Smith, Ocean Vuong, and Eduardo C. Corral, and many writers, such as Carmen GimeÃÅnez Smith and David TomaÃÅs MartiÃÅnez, have deep connections to their Latino communities. Collectively, these writers are enriching American poetry to reflect a more diverse, panoramic, and socially conscious literary landscape. Also featured are essays on the poets' literary ancestors--including Juan Felipe Herrera, Alurista, and Francisco X. AlarcoÃÅn--and speeches that address the need to leverage poetry as agency. This book fills a glaring gap in existing poetry scholarship by focusing exclusively on writers of color, and particularly on Latino poetry. GonzaÃÅlez makes important observations about the relevance, urgency, and exquisite craft of the work coming from writers who represent marginalized communities. His insightful connections between the Latino, African American, Asian American, and Native American literatures persuasively position them as a collective movement critiquing, challenging, and reorienting the direction of American poetry with their nuanced and politicized verse. GonzaÃÅlez's inclusive vision covers a wide landscape of writers, opening literary doors for sexual and ethnic minorities.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAmerican poetryxMinority authorsxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aPoets on poetry40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.971887102683nam a22003494a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202400250011004000180013504300120015305000230016510000270018824500450021526400660026030000220032633600260034833700260037433800360040050400670043650504350050352009860093858800570192465000300198165000450201165000450205665000570210165500220215871000610218085600920224120180606222500.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170929s2017    miu     o      00 0 eng d  a97804721232097 a10.3998/mpub.2969715  aMiUbengcMiU  ae-uk--- 4aML3521b.K453 20171 aKellett, Andrew James.14aBritish Blues Network /cAndrew Kellett. 1aAnn Arbor [Michigan] :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 223-248) and index.0 aIntroduction -- 1.

This cross-fertilization helped create a commercially successful rock idiom that gave rise to some of the most famous British groups of the era, including The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, Eric Clapton, and Led Zeppelin. What empowered these white, middle-class British men to identify with and claim aspects of the musical idiom of African-American blues musicians? The British Blues Network examines the role of British narratives of masculinity and power in the postwar era of decolonization and national decline that contributed to the creation of this network, and how its members used the tropes, vocabulary, and mythology of African-American blues traditions to forge their own musical identities.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aBlues (Music)xInfluence. 0aBlues (Music)zGreat Britainy1961-1970. 0aBlues (Music)zGreat Britainy1951-1960. 0aBlues (Music)zGreat BritainxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.296971502309nam a22004334a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000240011002400250013404000180015904300120017705000240018910000410021324501900025426400660044430000220051033600260053233700260055833800360058449000630062050000560068350400590073952004260079858800570122460000480128160000470132960000560137660000580143260000300149060000400152065000400156065000480160065500220164871000610167083000520173185600920178320180807194000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||171006s2017    miu     o      00 0 eng d  a9780472123223  a047212322Xq(print)7 a10.3998/mpub.9701749  aMiUbengcMiU  aa-ja--- 4aPL839.A7bC537 20171 aChambers, Anthony H.q(Anthony Hood)10aRemembering Tanizaki Jun?ÃÅ?ichiro and Matsuko /cAnthony H.

Deterrence in parliamentary war -- In search of a more effective deterrent -- Preventing nuclear war -- Conclusion.  aDysfunction in the contemporary Senate is driven by the deteriorating relationship between the majority and minority parties in the institution. In this environment, regular order is virtually nonexistent and unorthodox parliamentary procedures are frequently needed to pass important legislation. This is because Democrats and Republicans are now fighting a parliamentary war in the Senate to help steer the future direction of the country. James Wallner presents a new, bargaining model of procedural change to better explain the persistence of the filibuster in the current polarized environment, and focuses on the dynamics ultimately responsible for the nature and direction of contested procedural change. Wallner's model explains why Senate majorities have historically tolerated the filibuster, even when it has been used to defeat their agenda, despite having the power to eliminate it unilaterally at any point. It also improves understanding of why the then-Democratic majority chose to depart from past practice when they utilized the nuclear option to eliminate the filibuster for one of President Barack Obama's judicial nominees in 2013. On Parliamentary War's game-theoretic approach provides a more accurate understanding of the relationship between partisan conflict and procedural change in the contemporary Senate.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aUnited States.bCongress.bSenatexRules and practice. 0aFilibusters (Political science)zUnited States. 0aParliamentary practicezUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aLegislative politics & policy making.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.968664002509cam  2200373 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000360009202000330012802000180016102000150017902400250019404000180021904300120023705000240024924500970027326400550037026400100042530000370043533600260047233700260049833800360052450400510056052011580061158800570176965100390182665000320186565500220189770000330191970000300195271000610198285600920204320180716202156.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||171009s2017    miua    ob   s001 0 eng d  a9780472123261q(electronic bk.)  a0472123262q(electronic bk.)  a9780472037001  a04720370057 a10.3998/mpub.9697501  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us-mi 4aJK5816b.M53 2017eb00aMichigan government, politics, and policy /cedited by John S.

Steep economic decline in major industrialized cities like Detroit, Flint, and Pontiac have captured the attention of the national and international media, putting the spotlight on how state and local government has responded to these crises. This book provides a comprehensive analysis of Michigan's politics and government. Chapters elucidate the foundational aspects of the state's government (the Michigan Constitution and intergovernmental relations); its political institutions (the state legislature, governor, and court system); its politics (political parties and elections); and its public policy (transportation, education, and the economy). Throughout, these topics are enriched with detailed historical context, comparative analysis across state lines, coverage of relevant recent events, and projections for the future. An ideal fit for courses on state and local government, this thorough, well-written book will also appeal to readers simply interested in learning more about the inner workings of government in the Great Lakes State"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aMichiganxPolitics and government. 0aLocal governmentzMichigan. 4aElectronic books.1 aKlemanski, John S.,eeditor.1 aDulio, David A.,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.969750102580nam a22003614a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000240011002400250013404000180015904300120017705000240018908200160021310000330022924000240026224500350028626400660032130000220038733600260040933700260043533800360046149000200049752013650051758800570188265000410193965000430198065500220202371000610204583000200210685600920212620180807194000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170830s2017    miu     o      00 0 eng d  a9780472123292  a0472123297q(print)7 a10.3998/mpub.9408317  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us-hi 4aPS3558.O48bA6 201704a814/.542231 aHongo, Garrett Kaoru,d1951-10aEssays.kSelections14aMirror Diary /cGarrett Hongo. 1aAnn Arbor [Michigan] :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aPoets on poetry  aThe Mirror Diary tracks the emergence of an original poetic voice and a learned consciousness amid multiple and sometimes competing influences of complex literary traditions and regional and ethnic histories. Beginning with a literary inquiry into the history of Japanese Americans in Hawaii and California, Garrett Hongo draws on his own history to consider the mosaic of American identities--personal, cultural, and poetic--in the context of a postmodern diaspora. Hongo's essays attest to the breadth of what he considers his cultural inheritance and literary antecedents, ranging from the poets of China's T'ang Dynasty to American poets such as Walt Whitman and Charles Olson. He explains free-verse prosody by way of John Coltrane's jazz; praises his contemporaries, poets David Mura, Edward Hirsch, and Mark Jarman; and acknowledges his mentors, Bert Meyers and Charles Wright. In other pieces he engages with controversies and contestations in contemporary Asian American literature, confronts the politics of race and the legacy of Japanese American internment during World War II, offers paeans to the Hawaiian landscape, and addresses immigrants newly arrived in America with a warm welcome. The Mirror Diary is the work of a poet fully engaged with contemporary politics and poetics and committed to the study and celebration of diverse traditions.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aJapanese AmericanszHawaiixHistory. 0aPoets, AmericanzHawaiiy20th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aPoets on poetry40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.940831701809nam a22003854a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000240011002400250013404000180015904100130017704300120019005000260020210000390022824000280026724500750029526400660037030000220043633600260045833700260048433800360051049000630054650000350060952003600064458800570100460000600106165000480112165500220116970000270119171000610121883000520127985600920133120180807193900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170830s2017    miu     o      00 0 eng d  a9780472123346  a0472123343q(print)7 a10.3998/mpub.9702204  aMiUbengcMiU1 aenghjpn  aa-ja--- 4aPL839.A7bZ47813 20171 aTanizaki, Jun'ichir o,d1886-1965.10aY osh o jidai.lEnglish10aChildhood Years /cTanizaki Jun'ichir o ; translated by Paul McCarthy. 1aAnn Arbor [Michigan] :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aMichigan monograph series in Japanese studies ;vnumber 83  aTranslation of: Y osh o jidai.  aIn Childhood Years, originally published serially in a literary magazine between 1955 and 1956, Tanizaki Jun'ichiro (1886-1965) takes a meandering look back on his early life in Tokyo.

Disability on campus, on film : framing the failures of higher education.  aAcademic Ableism brings together disability studies and institutional critique to recognize the ways that disability is composed in and by higher education, and rewrites the spaces, times, and economies of disability in higher education to place disability front and center. For too long, argues Jay Timothy Dolmage, disability has been constructed as the antithesis of higher education, often positioned as a distraction, a drain, a problem to be solved. The ethic of higher education encourages students and teachers alike to accentuate ability, valorize perfection, and stigmatize anything that hints at intellectual, mental, or physical weakness, even as we gesture toward the value of diversity and innovation. Examining everything from campus accommodation processes, to architecture, to popular films about college life, Dolmage argues that disability is central to higher education, and that building more inclusive schools allows better education for all.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aCollege students with disabilities. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxEducation (Higher) 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aCorporealities.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.970872201605cam a2200397 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000440010702000280015102400240017904000180020304300120022105000220023308200190025510000270027424500960030126400550039730000220045233600260047433700260050033800360052649000610056250400510062358800570067465000600073165000530079165000460084465000450089065000370093565500220097271000610099483000610105585600910111620180606235315.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170331s2017    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a2016043290  a9780472130139q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472122387q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.340367  aMiUbengcMiU  ae-gx---00aD810.D6bC74 201700a940.54/2132231 aCrew, David F.,d1946-10aBodies and ruins :bimagining the bombing of Germany, 1945 to the present /cDavid F.

The essays gathered in this volume present multifaceted considerations of the intersection of objects and gender within the cultural contexts of late medieval France and England. Some take a material view of objects, showing buildings, books, and pictures as sites of gender negotiation and resistance and as extensions of women's bodies. Others reconsider the concept of objectification in the lives of fictional and historical medieval women by looking closely at their relation to gendered material objects, taken literally as women's possessions and as figurative manifestations of their desires. The opening section looks at how medieval authors imagined fictional and legendary women using particular objects in ways that reinforce or challenge gender roles. These women bring objects into the orbit of gender identity, employing and relating to them in a literal sense, while also taking advantage of their symbolic meanings. The second section focuses on the use of texts both as objects in their own right and as mechanisms by which other objects are defined. The possessors of objects in these essays lived in the world, their lives documented by historical records, yet like their fictional and legendary counterparts, they too used objects for instrumental ends and with symbolic resonances. The final section considers the objectification of medieval women's bodies as well as its limits. While this at times seems to allow for a trade in women, authorial attempts to give definitive shapes and boundaries to women's bodies either complicate the gender boundaries they try to contain or reduce gender to an ideological abstraction. This volume contributes to the ongoing effort to calibrate female agency in the late Middle Ages, honoring the groundbreaking work of Carolyn P. Collette" --cPublisher description.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aWomenzFrancexHistoryyMiddle Ages, 500-1500. 0aWomenzEnglandxHistoryyMiddle Ages, 500-1500. 0aSex rolezFrancexHistoryyTo 1500. 0aSex rolezEnglandxHistoryyTo 1500. 0aPersonal belongingszFrancexHistoryyTo 1500. 0aPersonal belongingszEnglandxHistoryyTo 1500. 0aMaterial culturezFrancexHistoryyTo 1500. 0aMaterial culturezEnglandxHistoryyTo 1500. 0aLiterature, MedievalxHistory and criticism. 0aLiterature, MedievalxWomen authorsxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.1 aAdams, Jenny,d1969-1 aBradbury, Nancy M.1 aCollette, Carolyn P.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.922273301350cam a2200349 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000440010702000270015102400250017804000180020304300120022105000210023308200150025410000280026924501540029726400550045130000220050633600260052833700260055433800360058050400510061658800570066765000300072465000270075465100440078165500220082571000610084785600920090820180607011803.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||160624s2017    miua    ob   s001 0 eng d  a2016028267  a9780472130221q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472122523q(ebook)7 a10.3998/mpub.9375465  aMiUbengcMiU  acl-----00aJL968b.N34 201700a324.982231 aNadeau, Richard,d1956-10aLatin American elections :bchoice and change /cRichard Nadeau, EÃÅric BeÃÅlanger, Michael S.

Status, gender identity, and cultural affiliations are just a few characteristics we can often infer about such material culture. But can we make similar deductions about the inhabitants of the first millennium BCE Greek world? Theoretical Approaches to the Archaeology of Ancient Greece offers a series of case studies exploring how a theoretical approach to the archaeology of this area provides insight into aspects of ancient society. An introductory section exploring the emergence and growth of theoretical approaches is followed by examinations of the potential insights these approaches provide. The authors probe some of the meanings attached to ancient objects, townscapes, and cemeteries, for those who created, and used, or inhabited them. The range of contexts stretches from the early Greek communities during the eighth and seventh centuries BCE, through Athens between the eighth and fifth centuries BCE, and on into present day Turkey and the Levant during the third and second centuries BCE. The authors examine a range of practices, from the creation of individual items such as ceramic vessels and figurines, through to the construction of civic buildings, monuments, and cemeteries. At the same time they interrogate a range of spheres, from craft production, through civic and religious practices, to funerary ritual"--Provided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aMaterial culturezGreecexHistoryyTo 1500. 0aCities and towns, AncientzGreece. 0aCemeterieszGreecexHistoryyTo 1500. 0aSocial archaeologyzGreece. 0aLandscape archaeologyzGreece. 0aGreecexAntiquities. 4aElectronic books.1 aNevett, Lisa C.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.828708201339cam a2200337 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000490010702000280015602400250018404000180020905000250022708200220025210000260027424501390030026400550043930000220049433600260051633700260054233800360056850400510060458800570065561000300071265000350074265000490077765500220082671000610084885600920090920180607004445.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||161020s2017    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a2016035933  a9780472130252q(hardcover : acid-free paper)  a9780472122585q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.8918784  aMiUbengcMiU00aJK1321.H57bW55 201700a328.730089/682231 aWilson, Walter Clark.10aFrom inclusion to influence :blatino representation in Congress and Latino political incorporation in America /cWalter Clark Wilson. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aUnited States.bCongress. 0aHispanic American legislators. 0aHispanic AmericansxPolitics and government. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.891878403449cam a2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000480010702000280015502400250018304000180020805000210022608200140024710000200026124500710028126400550035230000220040733600260042933700260045533800360048150400670051752021120058458800570269665000110275365000300276465000260279465000130282065000250283365000300285865500220288871000610291085600920297120180606235904.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||161117s2017    miua    ob   s001 0 eng d  a2016034791  a9780472130269q(hardback : acid-free paper)  a9780472122622q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.9296915  aMiUbengcMiU00aBD444b.K43 201700a306.92231 aKhapaeva, Dina.14aThe celebration of death in contemporary culture /cDina Khapaeva. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 241-252) and index.  a"The Celebration of Death in Contemporary Culture investigates the emergence and meaning of the cult of death. Over the last three decades, Halloween has grown to rival Christmas in its popularity and profitability; dark tourism has emerged as a rapidly expanding industry; and funerals have become less traditional. "Corpse chic" and "skull style" have entered mainstream fashion, while elements of gothic, horror, torture porn, and slasher movies have streamed into more conventional genres. Monsters have become pop culture heroes: vampires, zombies, and serial killers now appeal broadly to audiences of all ages. This book considers, for the first time, these phenomena as aspects of a single movement, documenting its development in contemporary Western culture. Previous considerations of our fixation on death have not developed a convincing theory linking the mounting demand for images of violent death and the dramatic changes in death-related social rituals and practices. This book offers a conceptual framework that connects the observations of the simulated world of fiction and movies--including The Twilight Saga, The Vampire Diaries, Night Watch, Hannibal, and the Harry Potter series--to social and cultural practices, providing an analysis of the specific aesthetics and the intellectual and historical conditions that triggered the cult of death. It also considers the celebration of death in the context of a longstanding critique of humanism and investigates the role played by 20th-century French theory, as well as by posthumanism, transhumanism, and the animal rights movement, in the formation of the current antihumanist atmosphere. With its critique of movie and book blockbusters and the death-related social rituals, festivals, and fashions that have coalesced into the cult of death, this timely volume will appeal to anyone hoping to better understand a defining phenomenon of our age. Scholars and general readers of cultural studies, film and literary studies, anthropology, and American and Russian studies will find this book thought-provoking"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aDeath. 0aDeath in popular culture. 0aCivilization, Modern. 0aCulture. 0aDeath in literature. 0aDeath in motion pictures. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.929691503859cam  2200517 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000180010702000150012502000180014002400250015804000180018304300120020105000240021308200210023724501720025824600500043024600710048024600730055126400550062430000370067933600260071633700260074233800360076852016410080450400510244558800570249661000460255361000470259961000470264665000660269365000690275965000560282865000510288465000540293565000490298965100330303861000320307165500220310370000300312570000330315571000610318885600920324920180227113605.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170523s2017    miua     b   s001 0 eng    a2017008990  a9780472130276  a0472130277  a97804721226467 a10.3998/mpub.9207853  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us-mi04aAM101.M65bO35 201700a069.09774/3522300aObject lessons & the formation of knowledge :bthe University of Michigan museums, libraries, & collections 1817-2017 /cKerstin Barndt and Carla M.

Since its inception, U-M has collected and preserved objects: biological and geological specimens; ethnographic and archaeological artifacts; photographs and artistic works; encyclopedia, textbooks, rare books, and documents; and many other items. These vast collections and libraries testify to an ambitious vision of the research university as a place where knowledge is accumulated, shared, and disseminated through teaching, exhibition, and publication. Today, 200 years after the university's founding, museums, libraries, and archives continue to be an important part of U-M, which maintains more than 20 distinct museums, libraries, and collections. Viewed from a historic perspective, they provide a window through which we can explore the transformation of the academy, its public role, and the development of scholarly disciplines over the last two centuries. Even as they speak to important facets of Michigan's history, many of these collections also remain essential to academic research, knowledge production, and object-based pedagogy. Moreover, the university's exhibitions and displays attract hundreds of thousands of visitors per year from the campus, regional, and global communities. Beautifully illustrated with color photographs of these world-renowned collections, this book will appeal to readers interested in the history of museums and collections, the formation of academic disciplines, and of course, the University of Michigan"--Provided by publisher.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.20aUniversity of MichiganxMuseumsxHistory.20aUniversity of Michigan.bLibraryxHistory.20aUniversity of MichiganxArchivesxHistory. 0aMuseumsxCollection managementzMichiganzAnn ArborxHistory. 0aCollection management (Libraries)zMichiganzAnn ArborxHistory. 0aArchiveszMichiganzAnn ArborxManagementxHistory. 0aCollege museumszMichiganzAnn ArborxHistory. 0aAcademic librarieszMichiganzAnn ArborxHistory. 0aLearning and scholarshipzMichiganxHistory. 0aMichiganxIntellectual life.20aBentley Historical Library. 4aElectronic books.1 aBarndt, Kerstin,eeditor.1 aSinopoli, Carla M.,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.920785301402cam a2200373 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000440010702000270015102400250017804000180020304300120022105000210023308200160025410000300027024501080030026400550040830000220046333600260048533700260051133800360053750400670057358800570064060000210069765000290071865000370074765000390078465100300082365500220085371000610087585600920093620180607014131.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||160929s2017    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a2016027840  a9780472130283q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472122677q(ebook)7 a10.3998/mpub.9297351  aMiUbengcMiU  ae-sp---00aDP102b.C77 201700a946/.022231 aCoope, Jessica A.,d1958-14aThe most noble of people :breligious, ethnic, and gender identity in Muslim Spain /cJessica A.

Through the lens of urban water provision, this book shows how politicians fail to provide reliable and high quality public services because they often benefit politically from manipulating public service provision for electoral gain. In many young democracies, politicians exchange water service for votes or political support, attempting to reward allies or punish political enemies. Surprisingly, the political problem of water provision has become more pronounced in many young democracies, as water service represents a valuable political currency in resource-scarce environments. When do politicians forgo the clientelistic manipulation of water services and invest in programmatic and universal service provision? Water and Politics finds that middle-class and industrial elites play an important role in generating pressure for public service reforms. Based on extensive field research and combining process tracing with a subnational comparative analysis of eight Mexican cities, Water and Politics constructs a framework for understanding the construction of universal service provision in these weak institutional settings"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aWater-supplyxPolitical aspectszMexico. 0aPublic utilitieszMexico. 0aPatron and clientzMexico. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.921046202054cam a2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000440010702000280015102400250017904000180020404300120022205000240023408200250025810000210028324501080030426400550041230000220046733600260048933700260051533800360054150400510057750505210062858800570114965000530120665000620125965000650132165000560138665100510144265500220149371000610151585600920157620180607013733.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170203s2017    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a2016047590  a9780472130337q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472122790q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.9343785  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us---00aHC110.C6bR623 201700a339.4/70973090422231 aRobbins, Mark W.10aMiddle class union :borganizing the "consuming public" in post-World War I America /cMark W.

Both the Tale's anti-semitism and its "Chaucerianism"-- its fitness or aptness as part of the Chaucerian canon--are significant topics of reflection for modern readers, who worry about the Tale's ethical implications as well as Chaucer's own implications. Over the past fifty years, scholars have asked whether the anti-semitism in the tale is that of the Prioress? Or of Chaucer the pilgrim? Or of Chaucer the author? Or, indeed, whether one ought to discuss anti-semitism in the Prioress's Tale at all, considering the potential anachronism of expecting medieval texts to conform to contemporary ideologies. The Critics and the Prioress responds to a critical stalemate between the demands of ethics and the entailments of methodology. The book addresses key moments in criticism of the Prioress's Tale--particularly those which stage an encounter between historicism and ethics--in order to interrogate these critical impasses while suggesting new modes for future encounters. It is an effort to identify, engage, and reframe some significant--and perennially repeated--arguments staked out in this criticism, such as the roles of gender, aesthetics, source studies, and the appropriate relationship between ethics and historicism. The Critics and the Prioress will be an essential resource for Chaucer scholars researching as well as teaching the Prioress's Tale. Scholars and students of Middle English literature and medieval culture more generally will also be interested in this book's rigorous analysis of contemporary scholarly approaches to expressions of anti-semitism in Chaucer's England"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aChaucer, Geoffrey,d-1400.tPrioress's tale. 0aAntisemitism in literature. 4aElectronic books.1 aJohnson, Hannah R.,d1974-2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.642658201890cam a2200349 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000440010702000280015102400250017904000180020404300210022205000250024308200180026810000200028624501080030626400550041430000220046933600260049133700260051733800360054350400670057950506130064658800570125965100240131665100250134065500220136571000610138785600920144820180607013357.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170210s2017    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a2016057154  a9780472130368q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472122868q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.9394056  aMiUbengcMiU  aa-is---aawba---00aDS109.916b.L37 201700a956.94/422231 aLassner, Jacob.10aMedieval Jerusalem :bforging an Islamic city in spaces sacred to Christians and Jews /cJacob Lassner. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 205-226) and index.0 aThe Holy Land and Jerusalem : singing praise to sacred space -- Jerusalem in the imagination of the prophet and his companions -- The "furthest place of worship" : Muslim tradition and modern scholarship -- The Islamization of Umayyad Jerusalem : the role of Mu'aÃÑwiyah b.

Ten Thousand Nights is a lively chronicle of a half-century of theatre-going, in which Carlson recalls one memorable production for each year from 1960 to 2010. These are not conventional reviews, but essays using each theater experience to provide an insight into the theater and theatre-going at a particular time. The range of performances covered is broad, from edgy experimental fare to mainstream musicals, most of them based in New York but with stops at major theater events in Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Milan, and elsewhere. The engagingly written pieces convey a vivid sense not only of each production but also of the particular venue, neighborhood, and cultural context, covering nearly all significant movements, theater artists, and groups of the late twentieth century"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aCarlson, Marvin,d1935- 0aTheaterzUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aAmerican dramay20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.920929301513nam a2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000440010702000410015102000270019202400250021904000180024404300120026205000220027408200200029610000200031624501570033626400550049330000220054833600260057033700260059633800360062249000410065850400670069958800570076665000320082365500220085570000290087770000270090671000610093383000410099485600920103520180713000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180111t20172017miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a2017298294  a9780472130511q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a047213051Xq(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472123186q(ebook)7 a10.3998/mpub.6201280  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us---00aKF4945b.P37 201704a328.73/07752231 aPark, Hong Min.10aPolitics over process :bpartisan conflict and post-passage processes in the U.S. Congress /cHong Min Park, Steven S.

The authors develop a theoretical framework that encapsulates pressures for revisionism through the mechanism of competition, and pressures for accommodation and assimilation through the mechanism of socialization. The identity and behavior of BRICS should be a product of these two forces as mediated by their domestic foreign policy processes. State identity is investigated qualitatively by using role theory and identifying national role conceptions, while economic and militarized conflict behavior are examined using Bayesian change-point modeling, which identifies structural breaks in a time series of data revealing potential wholesale revision of foreign policy. Using this innovative approach to show the behavior of rising powers is not simply governed by the structural dynamics of power, but also by the roles these rising powers define for themselves, they assert this process will likely lead to a much more evolutionary approach to foreign policy and will not necessarily generate international conflict"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aWorld politicsy21st century. 0aBRIC countriesxForeign relations. 0aBRIC countriesxForeign economic relations. 4aElectronic books.1 aNieman, Mark David.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.944968601642nam a2200421 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000440010702000280015102400250017904000180020404300210022205000210024308200160026424501080028026400550038830000220044333600260046533700260049133800360051749000930055350400510064658800570069765000180075465000410077265000200081365100200083365100230085365100220087665100250089865500220092370000350094571000610098083000870104185600920112820180607000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170326s2017    miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a2017009436  a9780472130573q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472123308q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.9514628  aMiUbengcMiU  ae------ae-gr---00aBL808b.R58 201700a292.3/822300aRitual matters :bmaterial residues of ancient religions /cedited by Jennifer Knust and Claudia Moser. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aSupplements to the Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome.

Author Dominic Symonds calls it a performance cartography, and argues that the city of New York maps its iconicity in the music of the Broadway songbook. A series of walking tours takes the reader through the landscape of Manhattan, clambering over rooftops, riding the subway, and flying over skyscrapers. Symonds argues that Broadway's songs can themselves be used as maps to better understand the city though identifiable patterns in the visual graphics of the score, the auditory experience of the music, and the embodied articulation of performance, recognizing in all of these patterns, corollaries inscribed in the terrain, geography, and architecture of the city. Through musicological analyses of works by Gershwin, Bernstein, Copland, Sondheim and others, the author proposes that performance cartography is a versatile methodology for urban theory, and establishes a methodological approach that uses the idea of the map in three ways: as an impetus, a metaphor, and a tool for exploring the city.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aMusicalszNew York (State)zNew YorkxHistory and criticism. 0aNew York (N.Y.)xSongs and musicxHistory and criticism. 0aNew York (N.Y.)xDramaxHistory and criticism. 0aNew York (N.Y.)xHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.563967202850cam a22004458i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000180010702000180012502000180014302000150016102000180017602000150019402400250020904000180023404300120025205000230026410000290028724501090031626400550042526400100048030000560049033600260054633700260057233800360059849000270063450400510066150504900071252008210120258800570202365000490208065000370212965000350216665500220220171000610222383000280228485600920231220170802135759.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||170511t20172017miua     b   s001 0 eng    a2017012514  a9780472900701  a9780472122844  a9780472053513  a0472053515  a9780472073511  a04720735167 a10.3998/mpub.4469010  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us---04aLC1099.3b.R6 20171 aRobbins, Sarah,eauthor.10aLearning legacies :barchive to action through women's cross-cultural teaching /cSarah Ruffing Robbins. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017] 4c√2017  a1 online resource (xii, 360 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew public scholarship  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.00aAcknowledgments -- CHAPTER ONE: Introduction: Counter-narratives and Cultural Stewardship -- CHAPTER TWO: "That my work may speak well for Spelman": Messengers Recording History and Performing Uplift -- CHAPTER THREE: Collaborative Writing as Jane Addams's Hull-House Legacy -- CHAPTER FOUR: Reclaiming Voices from Indian Boarding School Narratives -- CHAPTER FIVE: Learning from Natives' Cross-Cultural Teaching Coda: Composing New Learning Legacies -- Notes -- Bibliography -- Index.  a"Learning Legacies explores the history of cross-cultural teaching approaches, to highlight how women writer-educators used stories about their collaborations to promote community-building.

Although now relegated to the category of the pseudoscientific, fields like mesmerism and psychical research captured the imagination of the Victorian public. Conversely, many branches of science that we now view as uncontroversial, such as physics and botany, were often associated with unorthodox methods of inquiry. Whether incorporated into mainstream scientific thought, or relegated by 21st century historians to the category of the pseudo- or even anti-scientific, these sciences generated conversation, enthusiasm, and controversy within Victorian society.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 4aElectronic books.1 aKarpenko, Lara Pauline,eeditor.1 aClaggett, Shalyn R.,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.935734602302nam a2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000320010702000290013902000280016802000250019602400250022104000180024605000100026408200160027410000280029024500960031824600610041426400550047530000690053033600260059933700260062533800360065150001000068752007980078758800570158565000310164265000380167365500220171170000300173371000610176385600920182420161221000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||161122s2017||||miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||  a2016045491  a9780472130313q(print-ISBN)  a0472130315q(print-ISBN)  a9780472122714q(e-ISBN)  a0472122711q(e-ISBN)7 a10.3998/mpub.5555199  aMiUbengcMiU 4aML19304a780.9512231 aYang, Hon-Lun,eauthor.10aChina and the West :bMusic, Representation, and Reception /cHon-Lun Yang, Michael Saffle.30aChina and the West, Music, Representation, and Reception 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,cc2017.  a1 online resource (344 pages) :billustrations, figures, tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThis title was made Open Access by libraries from around the world through Knowledge Unlatched.3 aChina and the West: Music, Representation, and Reception is the first book to explore how Chinese and Western musical materials and traditions-those involving instruments, melodies, rhythms, staged diversions (including operas and musical comedies), concert works, film scores, and digital recordings of several kinds-have gradually moved closer together and become increasingly accepted, as well as exploited, in Asia as well as Europe and North America.

Scholars challenge the notion, formerly taken for granted, that extant historical texts-the writings of Vitruvius, for example-can directly inform the study of architectural remains. Roman-era statues, paintings, and mosaics are no longer dismissed as perfunctory replicas of lost Greek or¬† Hellenistic originals; they are worthy of study in their own right. Further, the scope of what constitutes Roman art has expanded to include the vast spectrum of objects used in civic, religious, funerary, and domestic contexts and from communities across the Roman Empire. The work gathered in Roman Artists, Patrons, and Public Consumption¬†displays the breadth and depth of scholarship in the field made possible by these fundamental changes. The first five essays approach individual objects and artistic tropes, as well as their cultural contexts and functions, from fresh and dynamic angles. The latter essays focus on case studies in Pompeii, demonstrating how close visual analysis firmly rooted in local and temporal contexts not only strengthens understanding of ancient interactions with monuments but also sparks a reconsideration of long-held assumptions reinforced by earlier scholarship. These rigorous essays reflect and honor the groundbreaking scholarship of Elaine K. Gazda. In addition to volume editors Brenda Longfellow and Ellen E. Perry, contributors include Bettina Bergmann, Elise Friedland, Barbara Kellum, Diana Y. Ng, Jessica Powers, Melanie Grunow Sobocinski, Lea M. Stirling, Molly Swetnam-Burland, Elizabeth Wolfram Thill, and Jennifer Trimble."0 aBeyond surprise : looking again at the Sleeping hermaphrodite in the Palazzo Massimo / Jennifer Trimble -- Dismembering a sacred cow : the Extispicium relief in the Louvre / Melanie Grunow Sobocinski and Elizabeth Wolfram Thill -- The Salutaris foundation : monumentality through periodic rehearsal / Diana Y.

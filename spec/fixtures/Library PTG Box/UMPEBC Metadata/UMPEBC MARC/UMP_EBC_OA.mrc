In Australia, newspapers were not only the main source of periodical fiction, but the main source of fiction in general. Because of their importance as fiction publishers, and because they provided Australian readers with access to stories from around the world-from Britain, America and Australia, as well as Austria, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, and beyond-Australian newspapers represent an important record of the transnational circulation and reception of fiction in this period. Investigating almost 10,000 works of fiction in the world's largest collection of mass-digitized historical newspapers (the National Library of Australia's Trove database), A World of Fiction reconceptualizes how fiction traveled globally, and was received and understood locally, in the 19th century. Katherine Bode's innovative approach to the new digital collections that are transforming research in the humanities are a model of how digital tools can transform how we understand digital collections and interpret literatures in the past.1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivativesuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aNewspapersxDigitizationzAustralia. 0aAustralian newspapers. 0aFictionxPublishingzAustraliaxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.1 iSupplement (work)aBode, KatherinetWorld of fiction : digital collections and the future of literary historyh1 online resource (research data sets) 0aDigital Humanities Ser.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.878477702836cam  2200421 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000340012902000330016302000310019602000310022702400300025804000270028805000090031510000300032424501140035426400640046830000230053233600260055533700260058133800360060749000350064350400510067852010640072953600630179354201280185658800570198465000340204165000340207565000320210965000260214165500220216771000610218977000720225085600920232220180904113246.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180704s2018    miu     ob   s001 0 eng    a9780472124343q(electronic book)  a047212434Xq(electronic book)  a9780472900862q(open access)  z9780472074037q(hardcover)  z9780462054039q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.99523772doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU10aP3061 aGonzales, Laura,eauthor.10aSites of translation :bwhat multilinguals can teach us about digital writing and rhetoric /cLaura Gonzales. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2018.  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aDigital Rhetoric Collaborative  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aWinner of the 2016 Sweetland Digital Rhetoric Collaborative Book Prize. Sites of Translation illustrates the intricate rhetorical work that multilingual communicators engage in as they translate information for their communities. Blending ethnographic and empirical methods from multiple disciplines, Laura Gonzales provides methodological examples of how linguistic diversity can be studied in practice, both in and outside the classroom, and provides insights into the rhetorical labor that is often unacknowledged and made invisible in multilingual communication. Sites of Translation is relevant to researchers and teachers of writing as well as technology designers interested in creating systems, pedagogies, and platforms that will be more accessible and useful to multilingual audiences. Gonzales presents multilingual communication as intellectual labor that should be further valued in both academic and professional spaces, and supported by multilingual technologies and pedagogies that center the expertise of linguistically diverse communicators.  aSponsored by the Sweetland Digital Rhetoric Collaborative.1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivativesuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aTranslating and interpreting. 0aTranslanguaging (Linguistics) 0aMultilingual communication. 0aLanguage and culture. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.1 iSupplement:aBloom, Gina,tSites of translationh2 bilingual videos40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.995237703244nam a22004213i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000310009202000280012302000290015102000260018002000350020602400300024104000270027104300210029805000280031910000260034724501000037324600460047326400650051926400100058430000340059433600260062833700260065433800360068050400510071652015470076753600370231454201650235158800570251663000320257365000210260565000210262665500220264771000610266985600920273020180810083010.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180406s2018    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a9780472900855qopen access  a0472900854qopen access  z9780472130634qhardcover  z0472130633qhardcover  z9780472123452qelectronic book7 a10.3998/mpub.97172842doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  aa-cc---aa-kr--- 4aGR335.4.L53bC46 2018eb1 aCho, Sookja,eauthor.10aTransforming gender and emotion :bthe Butterfly Lovers story in China and Korea /cSookja Cho.30aButterfly Lovers story in China and Korea 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4cÃ2018  a1 online resource (294 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aThe Butterfly Lovers Story, sometimes called the Chinese Romeo andÂ Juliet, has been enduringly popular in China and Korea. In Transforming Gender and Emotion, Sookja Cho demonstrates why the Butterfly Lovers Story is more than just a popular love story. By unveiling the complexity of themes and messages concealed beneath the tale's modern classification as a tragic love story, this book reveals the tale as a rich academic subject for students of human emotions and relationships, comparative geography and culture, and narrative adaptation. By examining folk beliefs and ideas that abound in the narrative-including rebirth and a second life, the association of human souls and butterflies, and women's spiritual power-this book presents the Butterfly Lovers Story as an example of local religious narrative. The book's cross-cultural comparisons, best manifested in its discussion of a shamanic ritual narrative version from the Cheju Island of Korea, frame the story as a catalyst for inclusive,Â  expansive discussion of premodern Korean and Chinese literatures and cultures. This scrutiny of the historical and cultural background behind the formation and popularization of the Cheju Island version sheds light on important issues in the Butterfly Lovers Story that are not frequently discussed-either in past examinations of this particular narrative or in the overall literary studies of China and Korea. This new, open approach presents an innovative framework for understanding premodern literary and cultural space in East Asia.  aSponsored by Knowledge Unlatched1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 Unported licenseuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher.00aLiang Shanbo yu Zhu Yingtai 0aFolklorezChina. 0aFolklorezKorea. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.971728402347nam a22004333i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000360009202000330012802000330016102000310019402000150022502000310024002000150027102400300028604000270031604300120034305000240035510000260037924500930040526400640049830000230056233600260058533700260061133800360063749000310067350400510070452006800075554201280143558800570156365000210162065000270164165000350166865000410170371000490174483000280179385600920182120180824172644.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180104s2017    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a9780472123315q(electronic bk.)  a0472123319q(electronic bk.)  a9780472900718q(open access)  z9780472053667q(paperback)  z0472053663  z9780472073665q(hardcover)  z04720736647 a10.3998/mpub.92563152doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  af-sa--- 4aN72.S6bB475 2017eb1 aBerman, Kim,eauthor.10aFinding voice :ba visual arts approach to engaging social change /cKim Shelley Berman. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2017.  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe new public scholarship  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aIn Finding Voice, Kim Berman demonstrates how she was able to use visual arts training in disenfranchised communities as a tool for political and social transformation in South Africa.

In the first book-length exploration of gaming in the early modern period, Gina Bloom shows that theaters succeeded in London's new entertainment marketplace largely because watching a play and playing a game were similar experiences. Audiences did not just see a play; they were encouraged to play the play, and knowledge of gaming helped them become better theatergoers. Examining dramas written for these theaters alongside evidence of analog games popular then and today, Bloom argues for games as theatrical media and theater as an interactive gaming technology. Gaming the Stage also introduces a new archive for game studies: scenes of onstage gaming, which appear at climactic moments in dramatic literature. Bloom reveals plays to be systems of information for theater spectators: games of withholding, divulging, speculating, and wagering on knowledge. Her book breaks new ground through examinations of plays such as The Tempest, Arden of Faversham, A Woman Killed with Kindness, and A Game at Chess; the histories of familiar games such as cards, backgammon, and chess; less familiar ones, like Game of the Goose; and even a mixed-reality theater videogame.  aSponsored by University of California, Davis, TOME initiative1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivativesuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aGameszGreat BritainxHistory. 0aTheaterzGreat BritainxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aTheater--theory/text/performance.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.983111803070nam a22004213i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000330010702000370014002000150017702000310019202400300022304000270025304300120028005000240029210000300031624500890034626400650043526400100050030000380051033600260054833700260057433800360060049000230063650400510065952013490071054201280205958800570218765000460224465000440229065500220233471000610235677000970241783000420251485600920255620180904102143.0m     o  d        cr un ---aaaaa180517t20182018miua    ob   s001 0 eng    a2018024343  a9780472900848q(open access)  a9780472123940q(electronic book)  a0472123947  z9780472130863q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.98471832doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU  an-us---14aHE6204.U5bB75 20181 aBrennan, Sheila,eauthor.10aStamping American memory :bcollectors, citizens, and the post /cSheila A.

While millions of Americans collected stamps from the 1880s to the 1940s, Stamping American Memory is the first scholarly examination of stamp collecting culture and how stamps enabled citizens to engage their federal government in conversations about national life in early-twentieth-century America. By examining the civic conversations that emerged around stamp subjects and imagery, this work brings to light the role that these under- examined historical artifacts have played in carrying political messages. Sheila A. Brennan crafts a fresh synthesis that explores how the US postal service shaped Americans' concepts of national belonging, citizenship, and race through its commemorative stamp program. Designed to be saved as souvenirs, commemoratives circulated widely and stood as miniature memorials to carefully selected snapshots from the American past that also served the political needs of small interest groups. Stamping American Memory brings together the histories of the US postal service and the federal government, collecting, and philately through the lenses of material culture and memory to make a significant contribution to our understanding of this period in American history1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivativesuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aStamp collectingzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aPostage stampszUnited StatesxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.1 iSupplement (work):aBrennan, SheilatStamping American memoryh1 online resource (50 photos) 0aDigital humanities (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.984718303842nam a22004333i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000310009202000350012302000290015802000290018702400300021604000270024605000160027324501260028926400650041526400100048030000510049033600260054133700260056733800360059350400510062950512560068052007340193653600370267054201660270758800530287365000370292665000480296365000380301165000450304965000560309465000460315065500220319670000340321871000640325285600920331620180904124324.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180828t20182018miu     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472901029qopen access  z9780472123445qelectronic book  z9780472073726qhardcover  z9780472053728qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.97316162doi  aMiUbengerdaepncMiU 4aPN1993.5.C400aEarly film culture in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Republican China :bkaleidoscopic histories /cedited by Emilie Yueh-yu Yeh. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018] 4cÃ2018  a1 online resource (364 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aIntroduction -- Part I.

Looking beyond relatively well-studied cities like Shanghai, these essays foreground cinema's relationship with imperialism and colonialism and emphasize the rapid development of cinema as a sociocultural institution. These essays examine where films were screened; how cinema-going as a social activity adapted from and integrated with existing social norms and practices; the extent to which Cantonese opera and other regional performance traditions were models for the development of cinematic conventions; the role foreign films played in the development of cinema as an industry in the Republican era; and much more.  aSponsored by Knowledge Unlatched1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 Unported licenseuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aMotion pictureszChinaxHistory. 0aMotion pictureszChinazHong KongxHistory. 0aMotion pictureszTaiwanxHistory. 0aMotion picture industryzChinaxHistory. 0aMotion picture industryzChinazHong KongxHistory. 0aMotion picture industryzTaiwanxHistory. 4aElectronic books.1 aYeh, Emilie Yueh-yu,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)eissuing body.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.973161603753nam a2200373 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000370009202000330012902000310016202000310019302400310022404000270025510000330028224500650031526400650038030000220044533600260046733700260049333800360051952019370055552000960249253600590258854201650264758800570281265000600286965000480292965000500297765500220302771000610304977001760311085600930328620180917091443.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180912s2018    miu     o     000 0 eng d  a9780472124817q(electronic book)  a9780472901036q(open access)  z9780472131242q(hardcover)  z9780472037384q(paperback)7 a10.3998/mpub.100798902doi  aMiUbengepnerdacMiU1 aGere, Anne Ruggles,eauthor.10aDeveloping writers in higher education /cAnne Ruggles Gere. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2018]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aFor undergraduates following any course of study, it is essential to develop the ability to write effectively. Yet the processes by which students become more capable and ready to meet the challenges of writing for employers, the wider public, and their own purposes remain largely invisible. Developing Writers in Higher Education shows how learning to write for various purposes in multiple disciplines leads college students to new levels of competence. This volume draws on an in-depth study of the writing and experiences of 169 University of Michigan undergraduates, using statistical analysis of 322 surveys, qualitative analysis of 131 interviews, use of corpus linguistics on 94 electronic portfolios and 2,406 pieces of student writing, and case studies of individual students to trace the multiple paths taken by student writers. Topics include student writers' interaction with feedback; perceptions of genre; the role of disciplinary writing; generality and certainty in student writing; students' concepts of voice and style; students' understanding of multimodal and digital writing; high school's influence on college writers; and writing development after college. The digital edition offers samples of student writing, electronic portfolios produced by student writers, transcripts of interviews with students, and explanations of some of the analysis conducted by the contributors. This is an important book for researchers and graduate students in multiple fields. Those in writing studies get an overview of other longitudinal studies as well as key questions currently circulating. For linguists, it demonstrates how corpus linguistics can inform writing studies. Scholars in higher education will gain a new perspective on college student development. The book also adds to current understandings of sociocultural theories of literacy and offers prospective teachers insights into how students learn to write.  aFinally, for high school teachers, this volume will answer questions about college writing.  aSponsored by the Humanities Collaboratory at Michigan.1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 Unported licenseuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aEnglish languagexRhetoricxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aReport writingxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aAcademic writingxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.1 iSupplement (work):aGere, Anne RugglestDeveloping writers in higher educationh1 online resource (appendix with more information about the research, surveys, and program)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1007989003513nam  2200493Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020003100204020002800235020002900263020002900292024003000321035002200351050001200373245011700385246006300502246002100565264006500586264001000651300003400661336002600695337002600721338003600747504004100783520155800824536007202382542015002454588006002604630002902664650002402693650001002717650002102727650003002748655002202778700003302800700003202833710006202865856009202927on107777375020181205010606.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181205t20192019miu     ob    000 0 eng d  aEYMbengepnerdacEYMdEYM  a9780472125272qelectronic book  a0472125273qelectronic book  a9780472901098qopen access  a0472901095qopen access  z9780472074150qhardcover  z9780472054152qpaperback7 a10.3998/mpub.96970412doi  a(OCoLC)1077773750 4aHM533.500a#identity :bhashtagging race, gender, sexuality, and nation /cAbigail De Kosnik and Keith P.

It has empowered minoritarian groups to organize protests, articulate often-underrepresented perspectives, and form community. It has also spread hashtags that have been used to bully and silence women, people of color, and LGBTQ people. #identity is among the first scholarly books to address the positive and negative effects of Twitter on our contemporary world. Hailing from diverse scholarly fields, all contributors are affiliated with The Color of New Media, a scholarly collective based at the University of California, Berkeley. The Color of New Media explores the intersections of new media studies, critical race theory, gender and women's studies, and postcolonial studies. The essays in #identity consider topics such as the social justice movements organized through #BlackLivesMatter, #Ferguson, and #SayHerName; the controversies around #WhyIStayed and #CancelColbert; Twitter use in India and Africa; the integration of hashtags such as #nohomo and #onfleek that have become part of everyday online vernacular; and other ways in which Twitter has been used by, for, and against women, people of color, LGBTQ, and Global South communities. Collectively, the essays in this volume offer a critically interdisciplinary view of how and why social media has been at the heart of U.S. and global political discourse for over a decade."  aSponsored by the Library of the University of California, Berkeley.1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial 4.0 Unported licenseuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/  aDescription based on information provided by publisher.00aTwitterxSocial aspects. 0aHashtags (Metadata) 0aRace. 0aGender identity. 0aNational characteristics. 4aElectronic books.1 aDe Kosnik, Abigail,eeditor.1 aFeldman, Keith P.,eeditor.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.969704103505nam a2200445Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003500137020003200172020003100204020002900235024003100264035002200295050001500317100002700332245008800359246004500447264006500492264001000557300002300567336002600590337002600616338003600642490004500678504004100723520165900764542015002423588005302573650003302626650001902659650003902678655002202717710006502739770012602804830003602930856009302966on107627471820181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126t20192019miu     ob    001 0 eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472125005qelectronic book  a0472125001qelectronic book  z9780472901043qopen access  z9780472131273qhardcover7 a10.3998/mpub.100192912doi  a(OCoLC)1076274718 4aP301.5.D371 aBrock, Kevin,eauthor.10aRhetorical code studies :bdiscovering arguments in and around code /cKevin Brock.30aDiscovering arguments in and around code 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019] 4cÃ2019  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aSweetland digital rhetoric collaborative  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 a"Software developers work rhetorically to make meaning through the code they write. In some ways, writing code is like any other form of communication; in others, it proves to be new, exciting, and unique. In Rhetorical Code Studies, Kevin Brock explores how software code serves as meaningful communication through which software developers construct arguments that are made up of logical procedures and express both implicit and explicit claims as to how a given program operates.â  Building on current scholarly work in digital rhetoric, software studies, and technical communication, Brock connects and continues ongoing conversations among rhetoricians, technical communicators, software studies scholars, and programming practitioners to demonstrate how software code and its surrounding discourse are highly rhetorical forms of communication. He considers examples ranging from large, well-known projects like Mozilla Firefox to small-scale programs like the "FizzBuzz" test common in manyâ  programming job interviews. Undertaking specific examinations of code texts as well as the contexts surrounding their composition, Brock illuminates the variety and depth of rhetorical activity taking place in and around code, from individual differences in style to changes in large-scale organizational and community norms. Rhetorical Code Studies holds significant implications for digital communication, multimodal composition, and the cultural analysis of software and its creation. It will interest academics and students of writing, rhetoric, and software engineering as well as technical communicators and developers of all types of software."1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International licenseuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0  aDescription based on information from publisher. 0aRhetoricxComputer programs. 0aCoding theory. 0aComputer softwarexSocial aspects. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),eissuing body.08iSupplement (work):aBrock, Kevin.tRhetorical code studies : discovering arguments in and around code.h1 online resource 0aDigital rhetoric collaborative.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1001929103269nam a2200457Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064040003200105020003700137020003400174020003300208020003000241020003100271024003000302035002200332050001500354100002500369245014100394246007100535264006500606300004000671336002600711337002600737338003600763490003400799504005100833520129300884536003802177542013202215588005302347650002302400650002102423650004402444655002202488710006502510770010802575830003602683856009202719on107627472120181126023900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||181126s2019    miua    ob    001 u eng d  aEYMbengerdaepncEYMdEYM  a9780472124558q(electronic book)  a0472124552q(electronic book)  a9780472900879q(open access)  a0472900870q(open access)  z9780472131112q(hardcover)7 a10.3998/mpub.99647862doi  a(OCoLC)1076274721 4aQA76.9.A941 aKee, Kevin,eauthor.10aSeeing the Past with Computers :bExperiments with Augmented Reality and Computer Vision for History /cKevin Kee and Timothy J Compeau.30aExperiments with Augmented Reality and Computer Vision for History 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2019]  a1 online resource :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aComp digial humanities series  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.3 aHerbert Blau (1926-2013) was the most influential theater theorist, practitioner, and educator of his generation. He was the leading American interpreter of the works of Samuel Beckett and as a director was instrumental in introducing works of the European avant-garde to American audiences. He was also one of the most far-reaching and thoughtful American theorists of theater and performance, and author of influential books such as The Dubious Spectacle, The Audience, and Take Up the Bodies: Theater at the Vanishing Point.In The Very Thought of Herbert Blau, distinguished artists and scholars offer reflections on what made Blau's contributions so visionary, transformative, and unforgettable, and why his ideas endure in both seminar rooms and studios.

In the past three decades, an extensive scholarly consensus emerged that these problems were created by fiscal indiscipline, the lack of sufficient concern for budgetary constraints from policy makers as they try to please voters. This approach formed the foundation for the fiscal surveillance system that attempted to bring borrowing in European countries under control via a set of fiscal rules. In the Red demonstrates that the problem of sustained, large-scale debt accumulation is an adjustment issue rather than a governance failure. Irrespective of whether the original impetus for borrowing arose from exogenous changes or irresponsible decision making, policy makers invariably initiate spending cuts and/or tax increases when debt grows at an alarming rate for several years in a row. ZsoÌfia Barta argues that explaining why some countries accumulate substantial amounts of debt for decades hinges on understanding the conditions required to allow policy makers to successfully put into place painful adjustment measures.  aSponsored by Knowledge Unlatched1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 Unported licenseuhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aDebts, PubliczDeveloped countries. 0aDeveloped countriesxForeign economic relations. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.972691501096nas a2200301 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000180011002400350012804000180016305000070018110000420018824500490023026400640027930000230034333600260036633700260039233800360041849000230045458800570047765000360053465500220057071000610059283000390065385601020069220141212160249.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||040715s2014    miu     o     000 1 eng d  a9780472120970  a97804720361657 a10.3998/tfcp.13240726.0001.001  aMiUbengcMiU04aPS1 aGoodman, Lauren Foss,d1982-eauthor.12aA heart beating hard /cLauren Foss Goodman. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2014.  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 a21st century prose  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAmerican fictiony20th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aTwenty-first century prose series.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/tfcp.13240726.0001.00101543nam a2200385Ia 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000390010702000380014602400330018404000180021705000280023508200150026310000210027824501050029926400550040430000510045933600260051033700260053633800360056249000560059850400510065458800570070563000220076265000360078465000370082065000250085765100350088265500220091771000610093983000570100085601000105720171026195700.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||100305s2010    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  z2010007914  a9780472070985 (cloth : alk. paper)  a9780472050987 (pbk. : alk. paper)7 a10.3998/toi.8008655.0001.001  aMiUbengcMiU 4aGV1469.25.W64bN37 201004a793.932221 aNardi, Bonnie A.10aMy life as a night elf priest :ban anthropological account of world of warcraft /cBonnie A.

This book illuminates the work of the poet Lucan, a contemporary of the emperor Nero. This maverick but socially prominent poet, whom Nero commanded to commit suicide at the age of 26, left an epic poem on the civil war between Caesar and Pompey that epitomizes the exuberance and stylistic experimentation of Neronian culture. This study focuses on Lucan's epic technique and traces his influence through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Martin Dinter's newest volume engages with Lucan's use of body imagery, sententiae, Fama (rumor), and open-endedness throughout his civil war epic. Although Lucan's Bellum Civile is frequently decried as a fragmented as well as fragmentary epic, this study demonstrates how Lucan uses devices other than teleology and cohesive narrative structure to bind together the many parts of his epic body. Anatomizing Civil War places at center stage characteristics of Lucan's work that have so far been interpreted as excessive, or as symptoms of an overly rhetorical culture indicating a lack of substance. By demonstrating that they all contribute to Lucan's poetic technique, Martin Dinter shows how they play a fundamental role in shaping and connecting the many episodes of the Bellum Civile that constitute Lucan's epic body. This important volume will be of interest to students of classics and comparative literature as well as literary scholars.

This book aims to answer that question by looking at a number of inter-related histories, as well as evaluating a wide range of methods and practices from fields in the humanities, social sciences, and information sciences to determine what might constitute the work and the world of digital rhetoric. The advent of digital and networked communication technologies prompts renewed interest in basic questions such as 'what counts as a text?' and 'can traditional rhetoric operate in digital spheres or will it need to be revised? Or will we need to invent new rhetorical practices altogether?' Through examples and consideration of digital rhetoric theories, methods for both researching and making in digital rhetoric fields, and examples of digital rhetoric pedagogy, scholarship, and public performance, this book aims to provides a broad overview of digital rhetoric by investigating the histories and boundaries that arise from one version of a map of the emerging field, focusing on the theories that are taken up and revised by digital rhetoric scholars and practitioners, as well as the methods (both traditional and new) that can be used to both study digital rhetoric and to potentially make new forms that draw on digital rhetoric for their persuasive power"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aRhetoricxData processing. 0aRhetoricxStudy and teaching. 0aDigital media. 0aOnline authorship. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aDigital humanities (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/dh.13030181.0001.00101481nam a2200373 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000450009202000180013702000280015502400250018304000180020804300120022605000230023810000200026124500970028126400100037826400640038830000340045233600260048633700260051233800360053850400510057458800570062565000700068265000620075265000560081465000250087065000370089565500220093271000610095485600920101520180127151800.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||131004t20132011miu     ob    001 0 eng|d  a9780472117338q(cloth : acid-free paper)  a9780472035687  a9780472120055q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.1798608  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us--- 4aPS310.N4bR36 20131 aRambsy, Howard.14aThe black arts enterprise and the production of African American poetry /cHoward Rambsy II. 4cÃ2011 1aAnn Arbor :bThe University of Michigan Press,c2013, 2011.  a1 online resource (199 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAmerican poetryxAfrican American authorsxHistory and criticism. 0aPoetryxPublishingzUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aAfrican AmericansxIntellectual lifey20th century. 0aBlack Arts movement. 0aAfrican Americans in literature. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.179860803121cam a2200397 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000300010702000280013702400250016504000180019004300120020805000260022008200180024610000240026424501140028826400550040230000220045733600260047933700260050533800360053149000610056750400510062852015630067958800570224265000440229965000470234365000540239065000420244465500220248671000610250883000620256985600920263120180927091243.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||131220s2014    miua    ob   s001 0 eng d  a2013040224  a9780472119196q(hardback)  a9780472120024q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.5732195  aMiUbengcMiU  ae-ge---00aPN1992.3.G4bG86 201400a302.23/452231 aGumbert, Heather L.10aEnvisioning socialism :btelevision and the Cold War in the German Democratic Republic /cHeather L.

In the first book in English to examine this topic, Heather L. Gumbert traces how television became a medium prized for its communicative and entertainment value. She explores the difficulties GDR authorities had defining and executing a clear vision of the society they hoped to establish, and she explains how television helped to stabilize GDR society in a way that ultimately worked against the utopian vision the authorities thought they were cultivating. Gumbert challenges those who would dismiss East German television as a tool of repression that couldn't compete with the West or capture the imagination of East Germans. Instead, she shows how, by the early 1960s, television was a model of the kind of socialist realist art that could appeal to authorities and audiences. Ultimately, this socialist vision was overcome by the challenges that the international market in media products and technologies posed to nation-building in the postwar period. A history of ideas and perceptions examining both real and mediated historical conditions, Envisioning Socialism considers television as a technology, an institution, and a medium of social relations and cultural knowledge. The book will be welcomed in undergraduate and graduate courses in German and media history, the history of postwar Socialism, and the history of science and technologies"--cProvided by publisher.

Republic -- Dickinson's remains -- Whitman's shrines -- Cold War editing and the rise of the "American literature industry" -- The death of the author has been greatly exaggerated.  a"Proofs of Genius: Collected Editions from the American Revolution to the Digital Age is the first extensive study of the collected edition as an editorial genre within American literary history. Unlike editions of an author's "selected works" or thematic anthologies, which clearly indicate the presence of non-authorial editorial intervention, collected editions have typically been arranged to imply an unmediated documentary completeness. By design, the collected edition obscures its own role in shaping the cultural reception of the author. In Proofs of Genius, Amanda Gailey argues that decisions to re-edit major authorial corpora are acts of canon-formation in miniature that indicate more foundational shifts in the way a culture views its literature and itself. By combining a theoretically-informed approach with a broad historical view of collected editions from the late eighteenth century to the present (including the rise of digital editions), Gailey fills a gap in the textual scholarship of the editing history of major figures like Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and of the American literary canon itself"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aDickinson, Emily,d1830-1886xAppreciation.10aWhitman, Walt,d1819-1892xAppreciation. 0aAmerican literaturexAppreciationzUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aAmerican literaturexAppreciationzUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aLiterature publishingzUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aLiterature publishingzUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aEditionszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aEditingzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aCanon (Literature) 0aAuthorshipxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aEditorial theory and literary criticism.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/etlc.13607061.0001.00103202nam a2200373 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000440010702000270015102400250017804000180020305000220022108200160024310000330025924501150029224600690040726400550047630000220053133600260055333700260057933800360060550400670064150501810070852016170088958800570250660000250256360000360258860000290262465500220265371000610267585600920273620180928000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||141230s2015    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a2014049364  a9780472119561q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472121083q(ebook)7 a10.3998/mpub.7711656  aMiUbengcMiU00aPA4417b.V36 201500a882/.012231 aVan Nortwick, Thomas,d1946-10aLate Sophocles :bthe hero's evolution in Electra, Philoctetes, and Oedipus at Colonus /cThomas Van Nortwick.1 aHero's evolution in Electra, Philoctetes, and Oedipus at Colonus 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2015]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 139-143) and index.0 aIntroduction : The Artist in Old Age -- Electra : Glory Bathed in Tears -- Philoctetes : The Creature in the Cave -- Oedipus at Colonus : Spiritual Geography -- Late Sophocles.2 a"Only a few plays by Sophocles--one of the great tragic playwrights from Classical Athens--have survived, and each of them dramatizes events from the rich store of myths that framed literature and art. Sophocles' treatment evokes issues that were vividly contemporary for Athenian audiences of the Periclean age: How could the Athenians incorporate older, aristocratic ideas about human excellence into their new democratic society? Could citizens learn to be morally excellent, or were these qualities only inherited? What did it mean to be a creature who knows that he or she must die? Late Sophocles traces the evolution of the Sophoclean hero through the final three plays, Electra, Philoctetes, and Oedipus at Colonus. The book's main thesis, that Sophocles reimagined the nature of the tragic hero in his last three works, is developed inductively through readings of the plays. This balanced approach, in which a detailed argument about the plays is offered in a format accessible to nonspecialists, is unusual--perhaps unique--in contemporary Classical scholarship on Sophocles. This book will appeal to nonspecialist readers of serious literature as well as scholars of classical and other literatures. While including ample guidance for those not familiar with the plays, Late Sophocles goes beyond a generalized description of "what happens" in the plays to offer a clear, jargon-free argument for the enduring importance of Sophocles' plays. The argument's implications for longstanding interpretational issues will be of interest to specialists. All Greek is translated." --cPublisher's description  aDescription based on information from the publisher.00aSophocles.tElectra.00aSophocles.tOedipus at Colonus.00aSophocles.tPhiloctetes. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.771165603646nam a2200493 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000480009202000490014002000280018902400250021704000180024204300120026005000230027208200180029510000350031324500970034826400100044526400590045530000230051433600260053733700260056333800360058949000610062550400510068650504280073752011980116558800570236365000490242065000480246965000410251765000560255865000730261465000600268765000440274765100450279165100390283665100410287565500220291671000610293883000610299985600920306020180127152300.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||141003t20142014miu     ob   s001 0 eng|d  a9780472119417q(hardback : acid-free paper)  a9780472036059q(paperback : acid-free paper)  a9780472120543q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.6713536  aMiUbengcMiU  ae-gw--- 4aHN460.V5bS43 20140 a303.609432231 aSedlmaier, Alexander,eauthor.10aConsumption and violence :bradical protest in Cold-War West Germany /cAlexander Sedlmaier. 4cÃ2014 1aAnn Arbor :bThe University of Michigan Press,c[2014]  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aDepartment Stores : Political Protest in the Commercial Sphere -- Neo-Marxist Critiques of Affluent Society : "Need to Break the Rules" -- Consumer Society under Fire : The Militant Targeting of an Abstract Enemy -- Public Transport : Protest against Fare Increases -- The Media : The Anti-Springer Campaign -- Urban Space : The Squatting Movement -- Global Responsibilities : In Search of Consumer Morality and Solidarity.2 a"Combining the tools of political, social, cultural, and intellectual history, Consumption and Violence : Radical Protest in Cold-War West Germany explores strategies of legitimization developed by advocates of militant resistance to certain manifestations of consumer capitalism. The book contributes to a more sober evaluation of West German protest movements, not just terrorism, as it refrains from emotional and moral judgments, but takes the protesters' approaches seriously, which, regarding consumer society, had a rational core. Political violence is not presented as the result of individual shortcomings, but emerges in relation to major societal changes, i.e., the unprecedented growth of consumption. This new perspective sheds important light on violence and radical protest in post-war Germany, as previous books have failed to examine to what extent these forms of resistance should be regarded as reactions to changing regimes of provision. Continuing the recently growing interest in the interdependence of countercultures and consumer society, the focus on violence gives the argument a unique twist, making the book thought-provoking and engaging"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPolitical violencezGermany (West)xHistory. 0aProtest movementszGermany (West)xHistory. 0aRadicalismzGermany (West)xHistory. 0aGovernment, Resistance tozGermany (West)xHistory. 0aConsumption (Economics)xPolitical aspectszGermany (West)xHistory. 0aCapitalismxPolitical aspectszGermany (West)xHistory. 0aSocial changezGermany (West)xHistory. 0aGermany (West)xPolitics and government. 0aGermany (West)xSocial conditions. 0aGermany (West)xEconomic conditions. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.671353601246cam  22003493  450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000150009202000180010702000150012502000180014002000180015802400330017604000180020905000160022724500630024324600500030626400470035630000230040333600260042633700260045233800360047849000240051458800570053865000590059565500220065470000160067671000610069283000430075385601000079620140317155133.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140128s2014    miu     o     000 0 eng d  a0472035959  a9780472035953  a0472119370  a9780472119370  a97804721204827 a10.3998/dh.12544152.0001.001  aMiUbengcMiU04aD16.255.C6500aPastplay :bteaching and learning history with technology.1 aTeaching and learning history with technology 1aAnn Arbor :bUniv Of Michigan Press,c2014  a1 online resource   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aDigital humanities.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aHistoryxStudy and teachingxTechnological innovations 4aElectronic books.1 aKee, Kevin.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aDigital humanities (Ann Arbor, Mich.).40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/dh.12544152.0001.00102269nam  2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000180010702000150012502000180014002000150015802400330017304000180020605000260022408200160025010000210026624500590028726400540034630000240040033600260042433700260045033800360047649000230051252009120053550400410144758800570148865000440154565000690158965500220165871000610168083000420174185601000178320130509161552.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||121218s2013    miu      b   s000 0 eng    a2012047396  a9780472118786  a0472118781  a9780472029136  a04720291347 a10.3998/dh.12146032.0001.001  aMiUbengcMiU04aD16.255.C65bK45 201300a907.8/52231 aKelly, T.

These literary experiments with early digital cultures from the 1990s comparatively retrace and speculate on the digital's transformative influence on prior understandings of the human, of social lives, and of individuals' relations to material lifeworlds, exploring the consequences of the apparent plasticity of the boundaries of the human, particularly for women, subaltern subjects, and others already considered liminally human. As these texts query the digital technics entering into textual practices, subjectivity, spatial practices and social networks, lived space, nation, and economic circulation, they reconceive their own literary print narrative methods and material modes of circulation in order to elaborate on unnoticed potentialities and limits of digital technics, providing a crucial means to reorient digital cultures of the present"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aExperimental fiction, AmericanxHistory and criticism. 0aLiterature and the

Always haunted by the commodification of blackness, African American literary production interfaces with the processes of publication and distribution in particularly charged ways. An energetic exploration of the struggles and complexities of African American print culture, this collection ranges across the history of African American literature, and the authors have much to contribute on such issues as editorial and archival preservation, canonization, and the "packaging" and repackaging of black-authored texts. Publishing Blackness aims to project African Americanist scholarship into the discourse of textual scholarship, provoking further work in a vital area of literary study"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAmerican literaturexAfrican American authorsxHistory and criticismxTheory, etc. 0aCriticism, Textual. 0aAmerican literaturexAfrican American authorsxPublishingxHistory. 0aLiterature publishingxPolitical aspectszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aAfrican AmericansxIntellectual life. 0aAfrican Americans in literature. 4aElectronic books.1 aHutchinson, George,d1953-1 aYoung, John K.q(John Kevin),d1968-2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aEditorial theory and literary criticism.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.258073201237nam a2200325Ia 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000390010702000380014602400370018404000180022105000280023908200140026710000180028124500610029926400550036030000510041533600260046633700260049233800360051850400510055458800570060565000360066265000260069865500220072471000610074685601040080720171026195700.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||090915s2010    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  z2009038405  a9780472070923 (cloth : alk. paper)  a9780472050925 (pbk. : alk. paper)7 a10.3998/dcbooks.7933339.0001.001  aMiUbengcMiU 4aGV1469.17.S63bM95 201004a794.82221 aMyers, David.10aPlay redux :bthe form of computer games /cDavid Myers. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,cc2010.  a1 online resource (184 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aComputer gamesxSocial aspects. 0aPlayxSocial aspects. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/dcbooks.7933339.0001.00102824cam  22004338i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000300010702000270013702000270016402000240019102000280021502000250024302400330026804000180030105000220031924500860034126400540042730000240048133600260050533700260053133800360055749000230059352012900061658800570190665000260196365000390198965000400202865000200206865000320208865500220212070000210214270000240216371000610218783000420224885601000229020131004104529.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||130731s2013    miu          s000 0 eng    a2013025449  a9780472072064q(hardback)  a0472072064q(hardback)  a9780472052066q(paper)  a0472052063q(paper)  a9780472029914q(e-book)  a0472029916q(e-book)7 a10.3998/dh.12230987.0001.001  aMiUbengcMiU00aD16.12b.W75 201300aWriting history in the digital age /cJack Dougherty, Kristen Nawrotzki, editors. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2013.  a1 online resource.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aDigital humanities  a"Writing History in the Digital Age began as a one-month experiment in October 2010, featuring chapter-length essays by a wide array of scholars with the goal of rethinking traditional practices of researching, writing, and publishing, and the broader implications of digital technology for the historical profession. The essays and discussion topics were posted on a WordPress platform with a special plug-in that allowed readers to add paragraph-level comments in the margins, transforming the work into socially networked texts. This first installment drew an enthusiastic audience, over 50 comments on the texts, and over 1,000 unique visitors to the site from across the globe, with many who stayed on the site for a significant period of time to read the work. To facilitate this new volume, Jack Dougherty and Kristen Nawrotzki designed a born-digital, open-access platform to capture reader comments on drafts and shape the book as it developed. Following a period of open peer review and discussion, the finished product now presents 20 essays from a wide array of notable scholars, each examining (and then breaking apart and reexamining) how digital and emergent technologies have changed the ways that historians think, teach, author, and publish"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aHistoryxMethodology. 0aAcademic writingxData processing. 0aHistoryxResearchxData processing. 0aHistoriography. 0aElectronic data processing. 4aElectronic books.1 aDougherty, Jack.1 aNawrotzki, Kristen.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aDigital humanities (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/dh.12230987.0001.00102200cam a2200421 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000400010702000280014702400250017504000180020004300120021805000220023008200270025210000170027924500970029626400540039330000220044733600260046933700260049533800360052150400680055750503800062558800570100565000720106265000610113465000770119565000620127265000510133465000590138565000880144465000710153265500220160371000610162585600920168620180927090837.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||131017s2014    miuabd  ob    001 0 eng d  a2013040288  a9780472119172q(cloth : alk. paper)  a9780472029983q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.3974910  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us-il00aML3479b.A26 201400a780.89/960730773112231 aAbsher, Amy.14aThe black musician and the white city :brace and music in Chicago, 1900-1967 /cAmy Absher. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2014.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references ( pages 187-198) and index.0 aMusicians and the segregated city : Chicago in the early 1900s-1930s -- From south to south side : musicians in 1940s Chicago -- Redefining the music industry : independent music in Chicago, 1948-1953 -- From south side to the south and the nation, 1954-1963 -- "The fact remains... we are negroes" : dissonance and the desegregation of Chicago's musicians' union, 1963-1967.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAfrican AmericanszIllinoiszChicagoxMusicxHistory and criticism. 0aPopular musiczIllinoiszChicagoxHistory and criticism. 0aPopular musicxSocial aspectszIllinoiszChicagoxHistoryy20th century. 0aMusic and racezIllinoiszChicagoxHistoryy20th century. 0aAfrican American musicianszIllinoiszChicago. 0aMusic tradezIllinoiszChicagoxHistoryy20th century. 0aAfrican American musiciansxLabor unionszIllinoiszChicagoxHistoryy20th century. 0aMusiciansxLabor unionszIllinoiszChicagoxHistoryy20th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.397491001966cam  22004818i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000280010702000440013502000410017902000390022002000360025902000280029502400340032304000180035704300120037505000230038710000220041024501250043226400580055730000240061533600260063933700260066533800360069149000200072750400510074750501490079858800570094765000450100465000480104965000380109765000360113565000410117165500220121270000230123470000250125770000190128271000610130183000210136285601010138320140929160201.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140328s2014    miu      b   s001 0 eng    a2014002777  a9780472120314q(e-book)  a9780472072156q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a0472072153q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472052158q(pbk. : alk. paper)  a0472052152q(pbk. : alk. paper)  a9780472120314q(e-book)7 a10.3998/nmw.12367206.0001.001  aMiUbengcMiU  aev-----00aP92.S34b.S97 20141 aSyvertsen, Trine.14aThe media welfare state :bNordic media in the digital era /cTrine Syvertsen, Gunn Enli, Ole J.

He contends that the next recession, certain to begin before the end of 1999, will reveal public policymakers' predictions of balanced budgets and millennial prosperity to be hubris of the highest order.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aUnited StatesxEconomic policyy1993-2001. 0aUnited StatesxEconomic policyy1981-1993. 0aGovernment spending policyzUnited States. 0aBudgetzUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1519901374nam a2200325 a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000400010702000370014702400370018404000180022105000280023908200140026710000270028124500660030826400540037430000220042833600260045033700260047633800360050250501930053858800570073165000330078865000400082165500220086171000610088385601040094420170718000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||071228s2008    miu     o     000 0 eng d  a2007052485  a9780472116355q(cloth : alk. paper)  a0472116355q(cloth : alk. paper)7 a10.3998/dcbooks.5682627.0001.001  aMiUbengcMiU00aGV1469.34.S52bR67 200800a794.82221 aRossignol, Jim,d1978-10aThis gaming life :btravels in three cities /cJim Rossignol. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2008.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aLondon -- How games make gamers -- The big smoke -- Seoul -- A gamers' world -- Propagandists -- Reykjavik -- The special relationship -- Model living -- Home : the window -- The playlist.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aVideo gamesxSocial aspects. 0aVideo gamesxPsychological aspects. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/dcbooks.5682627.0001.00101542nam a2200385Ia 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000180010702000180012502400330014304000180017605000220019408200160021610000310023224501120026326400540037530000870042933600260051633700260054233800360056849000380060450400510064258800570069361000430075065000310079365000360082465000390086065000360089965500220093571000610095783000380101885601000105620171026195700.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||100407s2010    miuaf   ob    001 0 eng d  z2010014033  a9780472071098  a97804720510907 a10.3998/nps.8582521.0001.001  aMiUbengcMiU 4aHV8883b.A44 201004a365/.662221 aAlexander, William,d1938-10aIs William Martinez not our brother? :btwenty years of the Prison Creative Arts Project /cBuzz Alexander. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2010.  a1 online resource (xii, 296 p., [16] pages of plates) :billustrations (some col).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe new public scholarship series  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.20aPrison Creative Arts ProjectxHistory. 0aArts in prisonszMichigan. 0aPrisoners as artistszMichigan. 0aCommunity arts projectszMichigan. 0aPrisonersxEducationzMichigan. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aThe new public scholarship series40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/nps.8582521.0001.00102650cam a2200409 a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000400010702000370014702000390018402000360022302400330025904000180029205000210031008200180033124501160034926400550046530000220052033600260054233700260056833800360059449000200063050000390065050400640068950511250075358800570187865000300193565000350196565500220200070000190202270000180204171000610205983000200212085601000214020180804164744.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||080125s2008    miuab   ob   s001 0 eng d  a2008002885  a9780472070435q(cloth : alk. paper)  a0472070436q(cloth : alk. paper)  a9780472050437q(pbk. : alk. paper)  a0472050435q(pbk. : alk. paper)7 a10.3998/nmw.5680986.0001.001  aMiUbengcMiU00aHM851b.T87 200800a303.48/3322204aThe hyperlinked society :bquestioning connections in the digital age /cJoseph Turow and Lokman Tsui, editors. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,cc2008.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew media world  a"Digital culture books"--Ser. t.p.  aIncludes bibliographical references (p. 289-303) and index.0 aIntroduction: on not taking the hyperlink for granted / Joseph Turow -- Structuring a marketplace of attention / James G.

Achen and T.Y. Wang.  a"The Taiwan Voter examines the critical role ethnic and national identities play in politics, utilizing the case of Taiwan. Although elections there often raise international tensions, and have led to military demonstrations by China, no scholarly books have examined how Taiwan's voters make electoral choices in a dangerous environment. Critiquing the conventional interpretation of politics as an ideological battle between liberals and conservatives, The Taiwan Voter demonstrates in Taiwan the party system and voters' responses are shaped by one powerful determinant of national identity--the China factor. Taiwan's electoral politics draws international scholarly interest because of the prominent role of ethnic and national identification. While in most countries the many tangled strands of competing identities are daunting for scholarly analysis, in Taiwan the cleavages are powerful and limited in number, so the logic of interrelationships among issues, partisanship, and identity are particularly clear.

Reagan symbolized a 1950s and 1960s America, largely white and suburban, with married couples and kids at home, who attended church more often than not. Obama's election marks a new era, the author writes. Whites will be a minority by 2042. Marriage is at an all-time low. Cohabitation has increased from a half-million couples in 1960 to more than 5 million in 2000 to even more this year. Gay marriages and civil unions are redefining what it means to be a family. And organized religions are suffering, even as Americans continue to think of themselves as a religious people. Obama's inauguration was a defining moment in the political destiny of this country, based largely on demographic shifts, as described in Barack Obama's America." -- Publisher's description.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aObama, Barack.10aReagan, Ronald. 0aFamilieszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aCoalitionszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aUnited StatesxSocial conditionsy1980- 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aContemporary political and social issues40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.1742202583nam a22003974a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000150011002000270012502000240015202400250017604000180020105000230021908200170024210000180025924500800027726400660035730000220042333600260044533700260047133800360049749000450053350000560057850400670063450501740070152009690087558800570184465000400190165000490194165500220199071000610201283000200207385600920209320180807194000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||180109r20182017miu     o      00 0 eng d  a9780472123414  a0472123416  a9780472073719q(print)  a0472073710q(print)7 a10.3998/mpub.9708722  aMiUbengcMiU 4aLC4812b.D653 201704a378.00872231 aDolmage, Jay.10aAcademic Ableism :bDisability and Higher Education /cJay Timothy Dolmage. 1aAnn Arbor [Michigan] :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2017]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCorporealities: discourses of disability  aIssued as part of book collections on Project MUSE.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 205-222) and index.0 a1.

Disability on campus, on film : framing the failures of higher education.  aAcademic Ableism brings together disability studies and institutional critique to recognize the ways that disability is composed in and by higher education, and rewrites the spaces, times, and economies of disability in higher education to place disability front and center. For too long, argues Jay Timothy Dolmage, disability has been constructed as the antithesis of higher education, often positioned as a distraction, a drain, a problem to be solved. The ethic of higher education encourages students and teachers alike to accentuate ability, valorize perfection, and stigmatize anything that hints at intellectual, mental, or physical weakness, even as we gesture toward the value of diversity and innovation. Examining everything from campus accommodation processes, to architecture, to popular films about college life, Dolmage argues that disability is central to higher education, and that building more inclusive schools allows better education for all.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aCollege students with disabilities. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxEducation (Higher) 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aCorporealities.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.970872202302nam a2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000320010702000290013902000280016802000250019602400250022104000180024605000100026408200160027410000280029024500960031824600610041426400550047530000690053033600260059933700260062533800360065150001000068752007980078758800570158565000310164265000380167365500220171170000300173371000610176385600920182420161221000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||161122s2017||||miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||  a2016045491  a9780472130313q(print-ISBN)  a0472130315q(print-ISBN)  a9780472122714q(e-ISBN)  a0472122711q(e-ISBN)7 a10.3998/mpub.5555199  aMiUbengcMiU 4aML19304a780.9512231 aYang, Hon-Lun,eauthor.10aChina and the West :bMusic, Representation, and Reception /cHon-Lun Yang, Michael Saffle.30aChina and the West, Music, Representation, and Reception 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,cc2017.  a1 online resource (344 pages) :billustrations, figures, tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThis title was made Open Access by libraries from around the world through Knowledge Unlatched.3 aChina and the West: Music, Representation, and Reception is the first book to explore how Chinese and Western musical materials and traditions-those involving instruments, melodies, rhythms, staged diversions (including operas and musical comedies), concert works, film scores, and digital recordings of several kinds-have gradually moved closer together and become increasingly accepted, as well as exploited, in Asia as well as Europe and North America.

Jonathan O. Wipplinger explores the history of jazz in Germany as well as the roles that music, race (especially Blackness), and America played in German culture and follows the debate over jazz through the fourteen years of Germany's first democracy. He explores visiting jazz musicians including the African American Sam Wooding and the white American Paul Whiteman and how their performances were received by German critics and artists. He also engages with the meaning of jazz in debates over changing gender norms and jazz's status between paradigms of high and low culture. By looking at German translations of Langston Hughes's poetry, as well as Theodor W. Adorno's controversial rejection of jazz in light of racial persecution, Wipplinger examines how jazz came to be part of German cultural production more broadly in both the US and Germany, in the early 1930s. Using a wide array of sources from newspapers, modernist and popular journals, as well as items from the music press, this work intervenes in the debate over the German encounter with jazz by arguing that the music was no mere "symbol" of Weimar's modernism and modernity. Rather than reflecting intra-German and/or European debates, it suggests that jazz and its practitioners, African American, white American, Afro-European, German and otherwise, shaped Weimar culture in a central way.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aJazzxSocial aspectszGermanyxHistoryy20th century. 0aJazzzGermanyy1921-1930xHistory and criticism. 0aMusic and racezGermany. 0aGermanyxCivilizationxAmerican influences. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.941695602260nam a2200349 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000320010702000290013902000280016802400250019604000180022105000120023908200210025124501200027224600800039226400550047230000690052733600260059633700260062233800360064850001000068452008230078458800570160765500220166470000370168670000340172371000610175785600920181820161221000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||161122s2017||||miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||  a2016035928  a9780472130177q(print-ISBN)  a047213017Xq(print-ISBN)  a9780472122455q(e-ISBN)7 a10.3998/mpub.9357346  aMiUbengcMiU 4aQ127.G504a509.41/0903422300aStrange Science :bInvestigating the Limits of Knowledge in the Victorian Age /cLara P.

Although now relegated to the category of the pseudoscientific, fields like mesmerism and psychical research captured the imagination of the Victorian public. Conversely, many branches of science that we now view as uncontroversial, such as physics and botany, were often associated with unorthodox methods of inquiry. Whether incorporated into mainstream scientific thought, or relegated by 21st century historians to the category of the pseudo- or even anti-scientific, these sciences generated conversation, enthusiasm, and controversy within Victorian society.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 4aElectronic books.1 aKarpenko, Lara Pauline,eeditor.1 aClaggett, Shalyn

scene during the Weimar period was one of the most vibrant in all of Germany, yet it has disappeared from memory and historiography. Breslau was a key center for innovative artistic production during the Weimar Republic; recovery of its history will shed new light on German cultural dynamics in the 1920s. Such a study has art historical significance because of the incredible extent of innovation that occurred in almost every intellectual field, advances that formed the basis for aesthetic modernism internationally and continue to affect the course of visual art and architecture today. Architecture education, just one example in many, is still largely based on a combination of the Bauhaus model from the 1920s and the model developed at the Breslau Academy of Fine and Applied Art. The exploratory attitude encouraged in Weimar era arts endeavors, as opposed to the conformism of academic art, is still a core value promoted in contemporary art and architecture circles. Given the long-lasting influence of Weimar culture on modernism one would expect to find a spate of studies examining every aspect of its cultural production, but this is not the case. Recent scholarship is almost exclusively focused on Berlin and the Dessau Bauhaus. Although both interests are understandable, the creative explosion was not confined to these cities but was part of a larger cultural ethos that extended into many of the smaller regional centers. The Expressionist associations the Blaue Reiter in Munich and BruÌcke in Dresden are two well-known examples. Equally, innovation was not confined to a few monumental projects like the Stuttgart Weissenhofsiedlung but part of a broader national cultural ethos. The dispersion of modernism occurred partly because of the political history of Germany as a loosely joined confederation of small city states and principalities that had strong individual cultural identities before unification in 1871 but also because of the German propensity to value and take intense pride in the Heimat, understood both as the hometown and the region. Heimatliebe translated into generous support for cultural institutions in outlying cities. Host to a roster of internationally acclaimed artists and architects, major collectors, arts organizations, museums, presses, galleries, and one of the premier German arts academies of the day, Breslau boasted a thriving modern arts scene until 1933 when the Nazis began their assault on so-called 'degenerate' art. This book charts the cultural production of Breslau-based artists, architects, art collectors, urban designers, and arts educators, who were especially interesting because they operated in the space between the margins of Weimar-era cultural debates. Rather than accepting the radical position of the German avant-garde or the reactionary position of German conservatives, many Breslauers sought a middle ground. It is the first book in English to address this history and presents the history in a manner unique to any studies currently on the market. Beyond the Bauhaus explores the polyvalent and contradictory nature of cultural production in Breslau in order to expand the cultural and geographic scope of Weimar history; the book asserts a reciprocal dimension to the relationship between regional culture and national culture, between centers like Breslau and the capital Berlin. With major international figures like the painters Otto Mueller and Oskar Moll, architects Hans Scharoun and Adolf Rading, urban planners Max Berg and Ernst May, collectors Ismar Littmann and Max Silberberg, and an art academy that by 1929 was considered the best in Germany, Breslau clearly had significance to narratives of Weimar cultural production. Beyond the Bauhaus contributes the history of German culture during the Weimar Republic. It belongs alongside histories of art, architecture, urban design, exhibition, collecting, and culture; histories of the Bauhaus; histories of arts education more broadly; and German history.

It presents a lively chronicle of months spent in the newsroom observing daily conversations, meetings, and journalists at work. We see Page One meetings, articles developed for online and print from start to finish, the creation of ambitious multimedia projects, and the ethical dilemmas posed by social media in the newsroom. Here, the reality of creating news in a 24/7 instant information environment clashes with the storied history of print journalism, and the tensions present a dramatic portrait of news in the online world.This news ethnography brings to bear the overarching value clashes at play in a digital news world. The book argues that emergent news values are reordering the fundamental processes of news production. Immediacy, interactivity, and participation now play a role unlike any time before, creating clashes between old and new. These values emerge from the social practices, pressures, and norms at play inside the newsroom as journalists attempt to negotiate the new demands of their work. Immediacy forces journalists to work in a constant deadline environment, an ASAP world, but one where the vaunted traditions of yesterday's news still appear in the next day's print paper. Interactivity, inspired by the new user-computer directed capacities online and the immersive Web environment, brings new kinds of specialists into the newsroom, but exacts new demands upon the already taxed workflow of traditional journalists. And at time where social media presents the opportunity for new kinds of engagement between the audience and media, business executives hope for branding opportunities while journalists fail to truly interact with their readers"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aJournalismzUnited StatesxHistoryy21st century. 0aOnline journalismzUnited StatesxHistoryy21st century. 0aJournalismxTechnological innovations. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aThe New Media World40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.513439101750nam a2200409 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000390009202000360013102000280016702400250019504000180022005000210023808200200025910000430027924500650032226400100038726400590039730000230045633600260047933700260050533800360053150400510056750502820061858800570090065000150095765000480097265000440102065000180106465000440108265000260112665000130115265500220116571000610118785600920124820180127152300.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140318t20142014miu     ob    001 0 eng|d  a9780472119097q(hbk. : alk. paper)  a0472119095q(hbk. : alk. paper)  a9780472029662q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.1965125  aMiUbengcMiU 4aK5256b.D68 20140 a363.325/1562231 aDouglas, Rogerq(Roger Neil),eauthor.10aLaw, liberty, and the pursuit of terrorism /cRoger Douglas. 4cÃ2014 1aAnn Arbor :bThe University of Michigan Press,c[2014]  a1 online resource   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aThe specter of terrorism -- Responding to the threat -- What is terrorism? -- Gathering information -- Protecting government secrets while protecting due process? -- Guilt by association -- Terrorism offences -- Detention without conviction -- Torture and coercive questioning.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aTerrorism. 0aTerrorismxPreventionxLaw and legislation. 0aNational securityxLaw and legislation. 0aCivil rights. 0aGovernment informationxAccess control. 0aDetention of persons. 0aTorture. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.196512501285cam a2200349 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000400010702000280014702400250017504000180020005000220021808200120024010000280025224500760028026400590035630000220041533600260043733700260046333800360048949000370052550400510056258800570061365000250067065000270069565500220072271000610074483000380080585600920084320180804170213.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||130508s2013    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a2013015596  a9780472119073q(cloth : alk. paper)  a9780472029594q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.4537117  aMiUbengcMiU00aPN2051b.R53 201300a7922231 aRidout, Nicholas Peter.10aPassionate amateurs :btheatre, communism, and love /cNicholas Ridout. 1aAnn Arbor :bThe University of Michigan Press,c[2013]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aTheater--theory/text/performance  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aTheater and society. 0aCommunism and culture. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aTheater--theory/text/performance.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.453711702760cam a2200421 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000430010702000280015002400250017804000180020304300120022105000220023308200220025510000220027724500920029926400550039130000220044633600260046833700260049433800360052049000430055650400670059952011390066658800570180565000350186265000490189765000390194665000270198565000650201265100440207765500220212171000610214383000420220485600920224620180804170210.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||130719s2013    miua    ob   s001 0 eng d  a2013015656  a9780472119011q(hardback : alk. paper)  a9780472029525q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.5085808  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us---00aJK1341b.E64 201300a328.73/0734552231 aEngstrom, Erik J.10aPartisan gerrymandering and the construction of American democracy /cErik J.

Engstrom offers a historical perspective on the effects of gerrymandering on elections and party control of the U.S. national legislature. Aside from the requirements that districts be continuous and, after 1842, that each select only one representative, there were few restrictions on congressional districting. Unrestrained, state legislators drew and redrew districts to suit their own partisan agendas. With the rise of the "one-person, one-vote" doctrine and the implementation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, however, redistricting became subject to court oversight. Engstrom evaluates the abundant cross-sectional and temporal variation in redistricting plans and their electoral results from all the states, from 1789 through the 1960s, to identify the causes and consequences of partisan redistricting. His analysis reveals that districting practices across states and over time systematically affected the competitiveness of congressional elections; shaped the partisan composition of congressional delegations; and, on occasion, determined party control of the House of Representatives"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aGerrymanderingzUnited States. 0aApportionment (Election law)zUnited States. 0aElection districtszUnited States. 0aVotingzUnited States. 0aRepresentative government and representationzUnited States. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and government. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aLegislative politics & policy making.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.508580802911nam a2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000320009202000290012402000280015302000250018102400240020604000180023005000090024808200190025710000280027624500760030424600570038026400540043726400110049130000690050233600260057133700260059733800360062350001000065950505450075952009040130458800570220865000400226565000460230565500220235171000610237385600910243420161221000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||161122s2013||||miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||  a9780472118724q(print-ISBN)  a0472118722q(print-ISBN)  a9780472029075q(e-ISBN)  a047202907Xq(e-ISBN)7 a10.3998/mpub.813135  aMiUbengcMiU 4aLC8904a372.2109732231 aKarch, Andrew,eauthor.10aEarly Start :bPreschool Politics in the United States /cAndrew Karch.30aEarly Start, Preschool Politics in the United States 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2013. 4cÃ2013.  a1 online resource (288 pages) :billustrations, figures, tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThis title was made Open Access by libraries from around the world through Knowledge Unlatched.0 aIntroduction: the preschool puzzle -- Early childhood policy and the American welfare state -- Historical precedents and forces for change -- A watershed episode: the comprehensive child development act -- Venue shopping, federalism, and the role of the states -- Congressional activity and the dissolving early childhood coalition -- Policy stability and political change in the 1980s -- The congressional heritage of a critical juncture -- The contemporary preschool movement in the states -- Conclusion: the future of preschool politics.3 aIn the United States, preschool education is characterized by the dominance of a variegated private sector and patchy, uncoordinated oversight of the public sector. Tracing the history of the American debate over preschool education, Andrew Karch argues that the current state of decentralization and fragmentation is the consequence of a chain of reactions and counterreactions to policy decisions dating from the late 1960s and early 1970s, when preschool advocates did not achieve their vision for a comprehensive national program but did manage to foster initiatives at both the state and national levels. Over time, beneficiaries of these initiatives and officials with jurisdiction over preschool education have become ardent defenders of the status quo. Today, advocates of greater government involvement must take on a diverse and entrenched set of constituencies resistant to policy change.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aEducation and statezUnited States. 0aEarly Childhood educationzUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.81313502592nam a2200409 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000320010702000290013902000300016802000270019802000280022502000250025302400250027804000180030305000130032108200190033410000300035324500580038326400540044126400110049530000690050633600260057533700260060133800360062750001000066350504050076352007090116858800570187765000330193465000400196765500220200771000610202985600920209020161221000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||161122s2012||||miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||  a2011043633  a9780472071715q(print-ISBN)  a0472071718q(print-ISBN)  a9780472051717q(pbk-ISBN)  a0472051717q(pbk-ISBN)  a9780472028245q(e-ISBN)  a0472028243q(e-ISBN)7 a10.3998/mpub.4350173  aMiUbengcMiU 4aPN56.A7304a809/.933572231 aSpurr, David A.,eauthor.10aArchitecture and Modern Literature /cDavid A.

The many prophetic and prognostic works that followed Europe's earliest known printed book---not the Gutenberg Bible, but the Sibyl's Prophecy, printed by Gutenberg two years earlier and known today only from a single page---over the next century were perennial best sellers for many printers, and they provide the modern observer with a unique way to study the history and inner workings of the print medium. The very popularity of these works, often published as affordable booklets, raised fears of social unrest. Printers therefore had to meet customer demand while at the same time channeling readers' reactions along approved paths.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aProphecyxChristianityxHistory. 0aPredictive astrologyxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.320924902842cam a2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000300010702000270013702000280016402400250019204000180021705000250023508200180026024500890027826400550036730000220042233600260044433700260047033800360049649000260053250400410055852014800059958800570207965000360213665000210217265500220219370000270221570000350224271000610227783000260233885600920236420161228111644.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||131029s2014    miua    ob   s000 0 eng d  a2013040292  a9780472071999q(hardback)  a9780472051991q(paper)  a9780472029532q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.5633302  aMiUbengcMiU00aPN1590.A54bA55 201400a791.8/02322300aAnimal acts :bperforming species today /cedited by Una Chaudhuri and Holly Hughes. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c[2014]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCritical performances  aIncludes bibliographical references.  a" Everyone has an animal story--the pet they loved or hated, the wild animal that captured their childhood imagination, the nasty dog at the end of the street, the deer your uncle shot or your neighbor hit while driving. Telling stories about animals is part of how we tell the story of being human, but recent scientific breakthroughs in animal cognition, the exploding interdisciplinary field of animal studies, and global climate change have all complicated these stories. Animal Acts collects some of the most exciting, provocative, and moving solo performances on animals, grounded by commentaries that help put these engaging works in a larger context. Animal Acts includes the work of leading theater artists Holly Hughes, Rachel Rosenthal, Deke Weaver, Carmelita Tropicana, and others, along with commentary by major scholars including Donna Haraway, Jane Desmond, Jill Dolan, and Nigel Rothfels. A masterful introduction by Una Chaudhuri provides readers a useful foundation for understanding and appreciating the intersection of animal studies and performance. The anthology makes an important contribution to several fields as it foregrounds questions of race, gender, sexuality, class, nation, and other issues central to the human project within the discourse of the "post human." The collection will be of interest to those interested in solo performance, animal studies, gender studies, performance studies, and environmental studies"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAnimals in the performing arts. 0aAnimal behavior. 4aElectronic books.1 aChaudhuri, Una,d1951-1 aHughes, Holly,d1955 March 10-2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aCritical performances40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.563330202588cam a2200421Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064010001700105040002700122020004100149020003800190020004000228020003700268020002800305020002500333024003900358035003900397050002800436082001400464100003000478245005600508264006600564300005200630336002600682337002600708338003600734490002500770504005100795520108000846588005701926650002301983655002202006710006202028830002602090856005002116ocn73191326220190115111514.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||110707s2011    miua    ob    001 0 eng    a  2011028327  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472071623q(cloth ;qalk. paper)  a0472071629q(cloth ;qalk. paper)  a9780472051625q(pbk. ;qalk. paper)  a0472051628q(pbk. ;qalk. paper)  a9780472027835q(e-book)  a0472027832q(e-book)7 a10.3998/lvg.11053908.0001.0012doi  a(OCoLC)731913262z(OCoLC)73191326400aGV1469.35.S54bP47 201100a794.82231 aPerron, Bernard,eauthor.10aSilent hill :bthe terror engine /cBernard Perron. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,cÂ©2011.  a1 online resource (162 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aLandmark video games  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  a"Silent Hill: The Terror Engine, the second of the two inaugural studies in the Landmark Video Games series from series editors Mark J.P. Wolf and Bernard Perron, is both a close analysis of the first three Silent Hill games and a general look at the whole series. Silent Hill, with its first title released in 1999, is one of the most influential of the horror video game series. Perron situates the games within the survival horror genre, both by looking at the history of the genre and by comparing Silent Hill with such important forerunners as Alone in the Dark and Resident Evil. Taking a transmedia approach and underlining the designer's cinematic and literary influences, he uses the narrative structure; the techniques of imagery, sound, and music employed; the game mechanics; and the fiction, artifact, and gameplay emotions elicited by the games to explore the specific fears survival horror games are designed to provoke and how the experience as a whole has made the Silent Hill series one of the major landmarks of video game history."--Publisher description.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aSilent Hill (Game) 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher. 0aLandmark video games.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/lvg.11053908.0001.00101909cam a2200469Ii 4500001001300000005001700013006001900030007001500049008004100064010001700105040002700122020004100149020003800190020004000228020003700268020001800305020001500323024001600338024003900354035002100393043001200414050002200426082002100448100002800469245008600497264006600583300005200649336002600701337002600727338003600753490006400789504006700853505013500920588005701055650005901112650003801171650005901209655002201268710006201290830003701352856005001389ocn68768100220190115111534.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||110218s2011    miua    ob    001 0 eng    a  2011007219  aEYMbengerdaepncEYM  a9780472071531q(cloth ;qalk. paper)  a047207153Xq(cloth ;qalk. paper)  a9780472051533q(pbk. ;qalk. paper)  a0472051539q(pbk. ;qalk. paper)  a9780472027606  a04720276038 a400197642097 a10.3998/toi.10329379.0001.0012doi  a(OCoLC)687681002  an-us---00aLC5131b.M34 201100a371.009173/22221 aMahiri, Jabarieauthor.10aDigital tools in urban schools :bmediating a remix of learning /cJabari Mahiri. 1aAnn Arbor, Michigan :bUniversity of Michigan Press,cÂ©2011.  a1 online resource (170 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aTechnologies of the imagination: new media in everyday life  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 153-161) and index.0 aNew literacies need new learning -- Hip-hop journalism -- Digital teachers -- "Virtual" world media -- A Second Life for learning.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aUrban youthxEducationxSocial aspectszUnited States. 0aCritical pedagogyzUnited States. 0aDigital communicationsxSocial aspectszUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan),epublisher. 0aTechnologies of the imagination.40uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/toi.10329379.0001.001

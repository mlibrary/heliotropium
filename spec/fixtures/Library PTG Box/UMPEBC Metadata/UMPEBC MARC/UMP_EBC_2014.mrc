Sparta's history is well known, but its archaeology has been much less satisfactorily explored. Through the comprehensive study of a distinctive class of terracotta votive offerings from a specific sanctuary, Gina Salapata explores both coroplastic art and regional religion. By integrating archaeological, historical, literary, and epigraphic sources, she provides important insights into the heroic cults of Lakonia and contributes to an understanding of the political and social functions of local ritual practice.This volume focuses on a large group of decorated terracotta plaques, from the sixth to fourth centuries BCE. These molded plaques were discovered with other offerings in a sanctuary deposit excavated near Sparta more than fifty years ago, but they have remained unpublished until now. They number over 1,500 complete and fragmentary pieces. In technique, style, and iconography they form a homogeneous group unlike any other from mainland Greece. The large number of plaques and variety of types reveal a stable and vigorous coroplastic tradition in Lakonia during the late Archaic and Classical period. Heroic Offerings will be of interest to students and scholars of Greek history, art, and archaeology, to those interested in ancient religious practice in the Mediterranean, and to all inspired by Athens' chief political rival, Sparta.

Grant banished Jewish citizens from the region under his military command. Although the order was quickly revoked by President Lincoln, it represented growing anti-Semitism in America. Convinced that assimilation was their best defense, Jews sought to Americanize by shedding distinctive dress, occupations, and religious rituals. American Jews recognized the benefit and urgency of bridging the divide between Reform and Orthodox Judaism to create a stronger alliance to face the challenges ahead. With Grant's 1868 presidential campaign, they also realized they could no longer remain aloof from partisan politics. As they became a growing influence in American politics, both political parties courted the new Jewish vote. Once in office, Grant took notice of the persecution of Jews in Romania and Russia, and he appointed more Jews to office than any president before him. Indeed, Simon Wolf, a Washington lawyer who became one of Grant's closest advisers, was part of a new generation of Jewish leaders to emerge in the post-Civil War era--thoroughly Americanized, politically mature, and committed to the modernized Judaism of the Reform movement"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aJewszUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aJewszUnited StatesxSocial conditionsy19th century. 0aJewszUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty19th century. 0aJudaismzUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aUnited StatesxEthnic relationsxHistoryy19th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.546967302766nam a2200445 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000300010702000310013702000280016802400250019604000180022105000220023908200190026110000240028024501270030426400540043130000220048533600260050733700260053333800360055949000560059550400510065152010330070258800570173565000390179265000320183165000610186365000310192465000400195565000440199565000340203965000340207365500220210771000610212983000380219085600920222820161006000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140227s2014    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a2013046279  a9780472072118q(hardback)  a9780472052110q(paperback)  a9780472120222q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.6487271  aMiUbengcMiU00aHB501b.A636 201400a327.09/0412231 aAnievas, Alexander.10aCapital, the state, and war :bclass conflict and geopolitics in the thirty years' crisis, 1914-1945 /cAlexander Anievas. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2014.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aConfigurations : critical studies of world politics  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  a"The history of the modern social sciences can be seen as a series of attempts to confront the challenges of social disorder and revolution wrought by the international expansion of capitalist social relations.

Anievas presents the Thirty Years' Crisis as a result of the development of global capitalism with all its destabilizing social and geopolitical consequences, particularly the intertwined and co-constitutive nature of imperial rivalries, social revolutions, and anti-colonial struggles. Building on the theory of uneven and combined development, he unites geopolitical and sociological explanations into a single framework, thereby circumventing the analytical stalemate between primacy of domestic politics and primacy of foreign policy approaches"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aCapitalismxHistoryy20th century. 0aCapitalismxSocial aspects. 0aInternational economic relationsxHistoryy20th century. 0aWorld politicsy1900-1945. 0aGeopoliticsxHistoryy20th century. 0aSocial conflictxHistoryy20th century. 0aWorld War, 1914-1918xCauses. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xCauses. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aConfigurations (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.648727101717cam a2200373 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000320010702000320013902000180017102400250018904000180021405000220023208200170025410000260027124500740029726400580037130000220042933600260045133700260047733800360050349000370053950400510057650504100062758800570103765000240109465000120111865500220113071000610115283000380121385600920125120161228111451.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140110s2014    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a2013044077  a9780472072132q(alk. paper)  a9780472052134q(alk. paper)  a97804721202917 a10.3998/mpub.6610419  aMiUbengcMiU00aPN2061b.Z36 201400a792.02/82231 aZamir, Tzachi,d1967-10aActs :btheater, philosophy, and the performing self /cTzachi Zamir. 1aAnn Arbor :bThe University of Michigan Press,c2014.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aTheater: theory/text/performance  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aIntroduction -- Life on the stage.

Cicero's speeches in the law-courts often incorporate theatrical devices including the use of family relatives as props during emotional appeals, exploitation of tears and supplication, and the wearing of specially dirtied attire by defendants during a trial, all of which contrast strikingly with the practices of the modem advocate. Hall investigates how Cicero successfully deployed these techniques and why they played such a prominent part in the Roman courts. These "judicial theatrics" are rarely discussed by the ancient rhetorical handbooks, and Cicero's Judicial Theater argues that their successful use by Roman orators derives largely from the inherent theatricality of aristocratic life in ancient Rome--most of the devices deployed in the courts appear elsewhere in the social and political activities of the elite. While Cicero's Judicial Theater will be of interest primarily to professional scholars and students studying the speeches of Cicero, its wider analyses, both of Roman cultural customs and the idiosyncratic practices of the law-courts, will prove relevant also to social historians, as well as historians of legal procedure"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aCicero, Marcus Tullius.tSpeeches. 0aSpeeches, addresses, etc., LatinxHistory and criticism. 0aOratory, Ancient. 0aTheaterzRome. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.187957102825cam a2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000420010702000440014902000280019302400250022104000180024604300120026405000230027608200220029910000220032124501180034326400540046130000220051533600260053733700260056333800360058949000550062550400670068052013470074758800570209465000310215165100440218265500220222671000610224883000380230985600920234720161228112035.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140327s2014    miua    ob   s001 0 eng d  a2014005569  a9780472072217q(hardback : alk paper)  a9780472052219q(paperback : alk. paper)  a9780472120376q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.6550836  aMiUbengcMiU  ae-uk---00aDA589.8b.M44 201400a327.41009/0452231 aMcCourt, David M.10aBritain and world power since 1945 :bconstructing a nation's role in international politics /cDavid M.

David M. McCourt maintains that the lack of a fundamental reorientation of Britain's foreign policy cannot be explained only by material or economic factors, or even by an essential British international "identity." Rather, he argues, the persistence of Britain's place in world affairs can best be explained by the prominent international role that Britain assumed and into which it was thrust by other nations, notably France and the U.S., over these years. Using a role-based theory of state action in international politics based on symbolic interactionism and the work of George Herbert Mead, Britain and World Power Since 1945 puts forward a novel interpretation of Britain's engagement in four key international episodes: the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Skybolt Crisis of 1962, Britain's second application to the European Economic Council in 1966-67, and Britain's reinvasion of the Falklands in 1982. McCourt concludes with a discussion of international affairs since the end of the Cold War and the implications for the future of British foreign policy"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aWorld politicsy1945-1989. 0aGreat BritainxForeign relationsy1945- 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aConfigurations (Ann Arbor, Mich.)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.655083602382nam a2200457 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000490010702000490015602000280020502400250023304000180025804300300027605000230030608200160032910000200034524501080036526400580047330000220053133600260055333700260057933800360060550400670064150505610070858800570126965000290132665000290135565000480138465000420143265000480147465000510152265000490157365100470162265100510166965100290172065500220174971000610177185600920183220161006000000.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140425s2014    miu     ob   s001 0deng d  a2013048529  a9780472072224q(hardcover : acid-free paper)  a9780472052226q(paperback : acid-free paper)  a9780472120383q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.6265337  aMiUbengcMiU  ae------aaw-----aff-----00aDG254.2b.L85 201400a937/.052231 aLuke, Trevor S.10aUshering in a new Republic :btheologies of arrival at Rome in the first century BCE /cTrevor S.

Despite much anecdotal evidence, few scholars have attempted to test the expectations gap thesis empirically. This is the first systematic study to prove the existence of the expectations gap and to identify the factors that contribute to the public's disappointment in a given president. Using data from five original surveys, the authors confirm that the expectations gap is manifest in public opinion. It leads to lower approval ratings, lowers the chance that a president will be reelected, and even contributes to the success of the political party that does not hold the White House in congressional midterm elections. This study provides important insights not only on the American presidency and public opinion, but also on citizens' trust in government"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPresidentszUnited StatesxPublic opinion. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and government. 4aElectronic books.1 aSilva, Carol L.1 aJenkins-Smith, Hank C.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.547071802200cam a2200421 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000400010702000280014702400250017504000180020004300120021805000220023008200270025210000170027924500970029626400540039330000220044733600260046933700260049533800360052150400680055750503800062558800570100565000720106265000610113465000770119565000620127265000510133465000590138565000880144465000710153265500220160371000610162585600920168620180927090837.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||131017s2014    miuabd  ob    001 0 eng d  a2013040288  a9780472119172q(cloth : alk. paper)  a9780472029983q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.3974910  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us-il00aML3479b.A26 201400a780.89/960730773112231 aAbsher, Amy.14aThe black musician and the white city :brace and music in Chicago, 1900-1967 /cAmy Absher. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2014.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references ( pages 187-198) and index.0 aMusicians and the segregated city : Chicago in the early 1900s-1930s -- From south to south side : musicians in 1940s Chicago -- Redefining the music industry : independent music in Chicago, 1948-1953 -- From south side to the south and the nation, 1954-1963 -- "The fact remains... we are negroes" : dissonance and the desegregation of Chicago's musicians' union, 1963-1967.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAfrican AmericanszIllinoiszChicagoxMusicxHistory and criticism. 0aPopular musiczIllinoiszChicagoxHistory and criticism. 0aPopular musicxSocial aspectszIllinoiszChicagoxHistoryy20th century. 0aMusic and racezIllinoiszChicagoxHistoryy20th century. 0aAfrican American musicianszIllinoiszChicago. 0aMusic tradezIllinoiszChicagoxHistoryy20th century. 0aAfrican American musiciansxLabor unionszIllinoiszChicagoxHistoryy20th century. 0aMusiciansxLabor unionszIllinoiszChicagoxHistoryy20th century. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.397491003095cam a2200337 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000300010702000220013702400250015904000180018405000210020208200170022324501070024026400540034730000220040133600260042333700260044933800360047552018650051158800570237665000480243365000480248165000240252965500220255370000290257571000610260485600920266520161228115236.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||131022s2014    miua    o    s000 0 eng d  a2013042052  a9780472119264q(hardback)  a9780472120116q()7 a10.3998/mpub.5242620  aMiUbengcMiU00aML197b.T63 201400a780.9/0422300aTomorrow is the question :bnew directions in experimental music studies /cedited by Benjamin Piekut. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2014.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  a"In recent decades, experimental music has flourished outside of European and American concert halls. The principles of indeterminacy, improvisation, nonmusical sound, and noise, pioneered in concert and on paper by the likes of Henry Cowell, John Cage, and Ornette Coleman, can now be found in a variety of new locations: activist films, rock recordings, and public radio broadcasts, not to mention in avant-garde movements around the world. The contributors to Tomorrow Is the Question explore these previously unexamined corners of experimental music history, considering topics such as Sonic Youth, Julius Eastman, the Downtown New York pop avant-garde of the 1970s, Fluxus composer Benjamin Patterson, Tokyo's Music group (aka Group Ongaku), the Balinese avant-garde, the Leicester school of British experimentalists, Cuba's Grupo de Experimentación Sonora del ICAIC, Pauline Oliveros's score for the feminist documentary Maquilapolis, NPR's 1980s RadioVisions, and the philosophy of experimental musical aesthetics. Taken together, this menagerie of people, places, and things makes up an experimentalism that is always partial, compromised, and invented in its local and particular formations--in other words, these individual cases suggest that experimentalism has been a far more variegated set of practices and discourses than previously recognized. Asking new questions leads to researching new materials, individuals, and contexts and, eventually, to the new critical paradigms that are necessary to interpret these new materials. Tomorrow Is the Question, gathering contributions from historical musicology, enthnomusicology, history, philosophy, and cultural studies, generates future research directions in experimental music studies by way of a productive inquiry that sustains and elaborates critical conversations"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aMusicy20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aMusicy21st centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aAvant-garde (Music) 4aElectronic books.1 aPiekut, Benjamin,d1975-2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.524262002720cam a2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000430010702000280015002400250017804000180020304300120022105000270023308200180026010000220027824500660030026400540036630000220042033600260044233700260046833800360049449000520053050400510058252012830063358800570191665000460197365000500201965000380206965500220210771000610212983000520219085600920224220161228114357.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140131s2014    miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a2013049687  a9780472119295q(hardback : alk. paper)  a9780472120208q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.5915695  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us---00aHQ1236.5.U6bG744 201400a306.874/32231 aGreenlee, Jill S.14aThe political consequences of motherhood /cJill S.

Politicized motherhood persists, and motherhood continues to inspire women's participation and direct their concerns. In The Political Consequences of Motherhood, Jill S. Greenlee investigates the complex relationship between motherhood and women's political attitudes. Combining a historical overview of the ways motherhood has been used for political purposes with recent political opinion surveys and individual-level analysis, she explains how and when motherhood shapes women's thoughts and preferences. Greenlee argues that two mechanisms account for the durability of motherhood politics. First, women experience attitudinal shifts when they become mothers. Second, "mother" is a broad-based identity, widely shared and ideologically unconstrained, that lends itself to appeals across the political spectrum to build support for candidates and policy issues"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aWomenxPolitical activityzUnited States. 0aMotherhoodxPolitical aspectszUnited States. 0aFeminismzUnited StatesxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aThe CAWP series in gender and American politics40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.591569501265cam a2200349 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000180009202000280011002400250013804000180016304300120018105000230019308200160021610000310023224500650026326400660032830000220039433600260041633700260044233800360046849000190050450400510052358800570057465000430063165000460067465500220072071000610074283000200080385600920082320161120172400.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||150422t20142014miua    ob    001 0 eng d  a9780472119448  a9780472120581q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.4664873  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us---14aRD594b.J64 2014eb04a616.8912231 aJohnson, Jenell M.,d1978-10aAmerican lobotomy :ba rhetorical history /cJenell Johnson. 1aAnn Arbor, [Michigan] :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2014.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCorporealities  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPsychosurgeryzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aFrontal lobotomyzUnited StatesxHistory. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aCorporealities.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.466487301966cam  22004818i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000280010702000440013502000410017902000390022002000360025902000280029502400340032304000180035704300120037505000230038710000220041024501250043226400580055730000240061533600260063933700260066533800360069149000200072750400510074750501490079858800570094765000450100465000480104965000380109765000360113565000410117165500220121270000230123470000250125770000190128271000610130183000210136285601010138320140929160201.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140328s2014    miu      b   s001 0 eng    a2014002777  a9780472120314q(e-book)  a9780472072156q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a0472072153q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472052158q(pbk. : alk. paper)  a0472052152q(pbk. : alk. paper)  a9780472120314q(e-book)7 a10.3998/nmw.12367206.0001.001  aMiUbengcMiU  aev-----00aP92.S34b.S97 20141 aSyvertsen, Trine.14aThe media welfare state :bNordic media in the digital era /cTrine Syvertsen, Gunn Enli, Ole J.

Nothing like these histories had been produced before in these cultures. Clio's Other Sons considers why that is: why were these histories written at this point, and for what purposes? Berossus and Manetho operated at the crossings of several political, social, and intellectual worlds. They were members of native elites under the domination of Macedonian overlords; in their writings we can see suggestions that they collaborated in the foreign rule of their lands, but at the same time we see them advocating for their cultures. Their histories were written in Greek and betray active engagement with Greek historical writing, but at the same time these texts are clearly composed from native records, are organized along lines determined by local systems of time-reckoning, and articulate views that are deeply informed by regional scholarly and wisdom traditions. In this volume John Dillery charts the interactions of all these features of these historians. An afterword considers Demetrius, the approximate contemporary of Berossus and Manetho in time, if not in culture. While his associates wrote new histories, Demetrius' project was a rewriting of an existing text, the Bible. This historiographical 'corrective' approach sheds light on the novel historiography of Manetho and Berossus"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aGreek literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aHistoriographyzGreecexHistoryyTo 1500. 0aEgyptxHistoriography. 0aBabyloniaxHistoriography. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.651153102910cam a22004334a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000180010702000150012502000300014002000270017002000240019702400380022104000180025904300120027705000250028908200200031410000240033424500920035826400540045030000220050433600260052633700260055233800360057850400510061452012770066558800570194265000590199965000480205865000460210665000450215265000460219765000450224365500220228871000610231085601050237120170717125226.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140903s2014    miu     o      00 0 eng d  z2014023464  a9780472120680  a0472120689  a9780472072385q(hardback)  a9780472052387q(paper)  a0472072382q(print)7 a10.3998/dcbooks.12672514.0001.001  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us---00aPS374.T434bS53 201400a813.009/3562231 aShackelford, Laura.10aTactics of the human :bexperimental technics in American fiction /cLaura Shackelford. 1aAnn Arbor :bUniversity of Michigan Press,c2014.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  a"Tactics of the Human: Experimental Technics in American Fiction examines the ways contemporary American fiction develops digital cultures through the creative transposition of digital rhetorics and technological practices, incorporating devices such as the hyperlink, network, and recursive processing into print or in translating a classic print narrative into a digital hypertext fiction. These literary experiments with early digital cultures from the 1990s comparatively retrace and speculate on the digital's transformative influence on prior understandings of the human, of social lives, and of individuals' relations to material lifeworlds, exploring the consequences of the apparent plasticity of the boundaries of the human, particularly for women, subaltern subjects, and others already considered liminally human.

December 1986, a Michigan State trooper found the frozen body of Jerry Tobias in the bed of his pickup truck. The 31-year-old oil field worker and small-time drug dealer was curled up on his side on the truck's bare metal, pressed against the tailgate, clad only in jeans, a checkered shirt, and cowboy boots. Inside the cab of the truck was a fresh package of expensive steaks from a local butcher shop--the first lead in a case that would be quickly lost in a thicket of bungled forensics, shady prosecution, and a psychopathic star witness out for revenge. Award-winning author Mardi Link's third book of Michigan true crime, Wicked Takes the Witness Stand, unravels this mysterious and still unsolved case that sucked state police and local officials into a morass of perjury and cover-up and ultimately led to the separate conviction and imprisonment of five innocent men. This unbelievable story will leave the reader shocked and aching for justice.

Telling stories about animals is part of how we tell the story of being human, but recent scientific breakthroughs in animal cognition, the exploding interdisciplinary field of animal studies, and global climate change have all complicated these stories. Animal Acts collects some of the most exciting, provocative, and moving solo performances on animals, grounded by commentaries that help put these engaging works in a larger context. Animal Acts includes the work of leading theater artists Holly Hughes, Rachel Rosenthal, Deke Weaver, Carmelita Tropicana, and others, along with commentary by major scholars including Donna Haraway, Jane Desmond, Jill Dolan, and Nigel Rothfels. A masterful introduction by Una Chaudhuri provides readers a useful foundation for understanding and appreciating the intersection of animal studies and performance. The anthology makes an important contribution to several fields as it foregrounds questions of race, gender, sexuality, class, nation, and other issues central to the human project within the discourse of the "post human." The collection will be of interest to those interested in solo performance, animal studies, gender studies, performance studies, and environmental studies"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aAnimals in the performing arts. 0aAnimal behavior. 4aElectronic books.1 aChaudhuri, Una,d1951-1 aHughes, Holly,d1955 March 10-2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aCritical performances40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.563330201617cam a2200409 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000430010702000400015002000280019002400250021804000180024304300120026105000210027308200160029410000290031024501290033926400550046830000220052333600260054533700260057133800360059749000310063350400670066458800570073165000510078865000400083965000410087965000390092065500220095970000420098171000610102383000310108485600920111520161228112954.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||131112s2014    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a2013031487  a9780472072071q(hardback : alk. paper)  a9780472052073q(paper : alk. paper)  a9780472120000q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.6029043  aMiUbengcMiU  an-us---00aLC111b.F43 201400a379.2/82231 aFeinberg, Walter,d1937-10aFor the civic good :bthe liberal case for teaching religion in the public schools /cWalter Feinberg and Richard A.

Acts and Reactions.2 a"Informed by contemporary theories of colonial photography and the history of U.S. imperialism, Dean Worcester's Fantasy Islands--a product of intensive archival research at the University of Michigan and elsewhere--is narrative in its approach, tracing Worcester's emergence both as a colonial administrator and a photographer and analyzing the intersections between his personal desires and his political agenda as they shaped his photography in the Philippines. Author Mark Rice discusses the controversies that surrounded Worcester's use of evocative photography and demonstrates his lasting influence on dominant modes of ethnographic photography as seen in the pages of National Geographic and elsewhere"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aWorcester, Dean C.q(Dean Conant),d1866-1924.10aWorcester, Dean C.q(Dean Conant),d1866-1924xPolitical and social views. 0aColonial administratorszPhilippinesvBiography. 0aPhotographerszPhilippinesvBiography. 0aPhotographyxPolitical aspectszPhilippinesxHistory. 0aPhotography in ethnologyzPhilippinesxHistory. 0aPhilippinesxHistoryvPictorial works. 0aPhilippinesxColonizationxHistory. 0aUnited StatesxRelationszPhilippines. 0aPhilippinesxRelationszUnited States. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.466534402181cam a2200385 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000440010702000390015102000280019002400250021804000180024305000220026108200160028324501140029926400590041330000220047233600260049433700260052033800360054650400510058250507290063358800570136265000420141965000340146165000340149565000390152965500220156870000340159070000180162471000610164285600920170320180927092153.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140325s2014    miu     ob   s001 0 eng d  a2013051031  a9780472072231q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472052233q(pbk. : alk. paper)  a9780472120390q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.5960287  aMiUbengcMiU00aHV639b.P656 201400a303.6/922304aThe post-conflict environment :binvestigation and critique /cDaniel Bertrand Monk and Jacob Mundy, editors. 1aAnn Arbor :bThe University of Michigan Press,c[2014]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aThe post-conflict environment : a genealogy / Daniel Bertrand Monk and Jacob Mundy -- Statebuilding in a vacuum : Sierra Leone and the missing international political economy of civil wars / Catherine Goetze -- The performance and politics of trauma in northern Iraq / Sarah Keeler -- Algeria and the violence of national reconciliation / Jacob Mundy -- The work of exile : protracted refugee situations and the new Palestinian normal / Romola Sanyal -- Constructing reconstruction : building Kosovo's post-conflict environment / Andrew Herscher -- International finance and the reconstruction of Beirut : war by other means?

artists and performers have interrogated tropes and mythologies of whiteness to reveal racial inequalities, focusing on comedy sketches, street theater, visual art, video, TV journalism, and voice-over work since 1964. By investigating enactments of whiteness--from the use of white makeup and suggestive masks, to literary motifs and cultural narratives regarding "white" characteristics and qualities--Faedra Chatard Carpenter explores how artists have challenged commonly held notions of racial identity. Through its layered study of expressive culture, her book considers how artistic and performance strategies are used to "color" whiteness and complicate blackness in our contemporary moment. Utilizing theories of performance and critical race studies, Coloring Whiteness is also propelled by Carpenter's dramaturgical sensibilities. Her analysis of primary performance texts is informed not only by traditional print and visual materials, but also by her interviews with African American theater artists, visual artists, and cultural critics. The book is an invaluable contribution to the fields of theater and performance studies, African American studies, cultural studies, critical race studies, and American studies"--cProvided by

Paton gave adult adoptees a voice and provided them with a healthy self-image; facilitated thousands of meetings between adult adoptees and their families of origin; fought to open sealed adoption records; and indefatigably explained the adoption experience to a wider public. Paton's ceaseless activity created the preconditions for the explosive emergence of the adoption reform movement in the 1970s. She was also instrumental in the formation of two of the movement's most vital organizations, Concerned United Birthparents and the American Adoption Congress. Using previously unexamined sources, historian E. Wayne Carp offers the first-ever biography of Jean Paton. Beginning in 1951, Paton, a twice-adopted, middle-aged ex-social worker, dedicated her life to overcoming American society's prejudices against adult adoptees and women who give birth out of wedlock. Her unflagging efforts over the next five decades helped reverse social workers' harmful policy and practice concerning adoption and sealed adoption records and change lawmakers' enactment of laws prejudicial to adult adoptees and birth mothers, struggles that continue to this day"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aPaton, Jean M.,d1908-2002. 0aAdoptionzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aOpen adoptionzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aAdopteeszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aBirthparentszUnited StatesxHistory. 0aSocial workerszUnited StatesvBiography. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.624201802907cam a2200481 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000450010702000280015202400250018004000180020504300300022305000220025308200210027524501360029626400590043230000220049133600260051333700260053933800360056549000610060150400670066252009110072958800570164065000510169765000490174865000520179765100400184965100380188965100410192765100510196865100490201965100520206865500220212070000180214270000230216070000280218371000610221183000610227285600920233320161228113105.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||131112s2014    miua    ob   s001 0 eng d  a2013031519  a9780472119127q(cloth : acid-free paper)  a9780472029709q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.5034425  aMiUbengcMiU  ae-gx---af------aa------00aJV2035b.G37 201400a909/.097124322300aGerman colonialism revisited :bAfrican, Asian, and Oceanic experiences /cNina Berman, Klaus Mühlhahn, Patrice Nganang, editors. 1aAnn Arbor :bThe University of Michigan Press,c[2014]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 299-331) and index.2 a"German Colonialism Revisited brings together military historians, art historians, literary scholars, cultural theorists, and linguists to address a range of issues surrounding colonized African, Asian, and Oceanic people's creative reactions to and interactions with German colonialism. This scholarship sheds new light on local power dynamics; agency; and economic, cultural, and social networks that preceded and, as some now argue, ultimately structured German colonial rule. Going beyond issues of resistance, these essays present colonialism as a shared event from which both the colonized and the colonizers emerged changed. They contribute to current debates on transnational and intercultural processes and highlight the ways in which the legacy of the German colonial period is embedded in the global expansion of capitalism, technology, and the Western legal framework"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aIndigenous peopleszAfricaxSocial conditions. 0aIndigenous peopleszAsiaxSocial conditions. 0aIndigenous peopleszOceaniaxSocial conditions. 0aGermanyxColonieszAfricaxHistory. 0aGermanyxColonieszAsiaxHistory. 0aGermanyxColonieszOceaniaxHistory. 0aAfricaxColonizationxSocial aspectsxHistory. 0aAsiaxColonizationxSocial aspectsxHistory. 0aOceaniaxColonizationxSocial aspectsxHistory. 4aElectronic books.1 aBerman, Nina.1 aMühlhahn, Klaus.1 aNganang, Alain Patrice.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.503442502426cam a2200469 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000450010702000270015202400250017904000180020404300120022205000220023408200190025610000200027524501020029526400590039730000220045633600260047833700260050433800360053049000610056650400670062750505120069458800570120665000380126365000410130165000390134265000640138165000380144565000480148365000590153165100390159065100460162965100450167565500220172071000610174283000610180385600920186420161228114253.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||130909s2014    miua    ob   s001 0 eng d  a2013035567  a9780472119134q(cloth : acid-free paper)  a9780472029723q(ebook)7 a10.3998/mpub.4573218  aMiUbengcMiU  ae-ge---00aG155.G3bM67 201400a914.3104872231 aMoranda, Scott.14aThe people's own landscape :bnature, tourism, and dictatorship in East Germany /cScott Moranda. 1aAnn Arbor :bThe University of Michigan Press,c[2014]  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 187-213) and index.0 aChapter 1.

In the first book in English to examine this topic, Heather L. Gumbert traces how television became a medium prized for its communicative and entertainment value. She explores the difficulties GDR authorities had defining and executing a clear vision of the society they hoped to establish, and she explains how television helped to stabilize GDR society in a way that ultimately worked against the utopian vision the authorities thought they were cultivating. Gumbert challenges those who would dismiss East German television as a tool of repression that couldn't compete with the West or capture the imagination of East Germans. Instead, she shows how, by the early 1960s, television was a model of the kind of socialist realist art that could appeal to authorities and audiences. Ultimately, this socialist vision was overcome by the challenges that the international market in media products and technologies posed to nation-building in the postwar period. A history of ideas and perceptions examining both real and mediated historical conditions, Envisioning Socialism considers television as a technology, an institution, and a medium of social relations and cultural knowledge. The book will be welcomed in undergraduate and graduate courses in German and media history, the history of postwar Socialism, and the history of science and technologies"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aTelevision and politicszGermany (East) 0aTelevisionxSocial aspectszGermany (East) 0aTelevision broadcastingzGermany (East)xHistory. 0aSocialism and societyzGermany (East) 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in germany.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.573219502099cam a2200361 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000420010702000280014902400250017704000180020205000230022008200190024310000310026224501200029326400590041330000220047233600260049433700260052033800360054650400670058250506700064952000890131958800570140865000300146565000290149565000380152465500220156271000610158485600920164520161228114900.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140108s2014    miua    ob   s001 0 eng d  a2013045746  a9780472119202q(hardback : acid-free)  a9780472120062q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.5626042  aMiUbengcMiU00aPN56.S54bM67 201400a809/.933552231 aMorrison, James V.,d1956-10aShipwrecked :bdisaster and transformation in Homer, Shakespeare, Defoe, and the modern world /cJames V.

It presents a lively chronicle of months spent in the newsroom observing daily conversations, meetings, and journalists at work. We see Page One meetings, articles developed for online and print from start to finish, the creation of ambitious multimedia projects, and the ethical dilemmas posed by social media in the newsroom. Here, the reality of creating news in a 24/7 instant information environment clashes with the storied history of print journalism, and the tensions present a dramatic portrait of news in the online world.This news ethnography brings to bear the overarching value clashes at play in a digital news world. The book argues that emergent news values are reordering the fundamental processes of news production. Immediacy, interactivity, and participation now play a role unlike any time before, creating clashes between old and new. These values emerge from the social practices, pressures, and norms at play inside the newsroom as journalists attempt to negotiate the new demands of their work. Immediacy forces journalists to work in a constant deadline environment, an ASAP world, but one where the vaunted traditions of yesterday's news still appear in the next day's print paper. Interactivity, inspired by the new user-computer directed capacities online and the immersive Web environment, brings new kinds of specialists into the newsroom, but exacts new demands upon the already taxed workflow of traditional journalists. And at time where social media presents the opportunity for new kinds of engagement between the audience and media, business executives hope for branding opportunities while journalists fail to truly interact with their readers"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aJournalismzUnited StatesxHistoryy21st century. 0aOnline journalismzUnited

Michta.  aThe conclusion of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) operations in Afghanistan in 2014 closes an important chapter in the history of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In this volume, European and US experts examine a range of perennial issues facing the Alliance, including relations with Russia, NATO's institutional organization and command structure, and the role of the United States in the Alliance, in order to show how these issues shape today's most pressing debate-the debate over the balance between NATO's engagement in security operations globally and traditional defense within the North-Atlantic region. The volume's contributors propose that NATO can indeed find a viable balance between competing, but not inherently incompatible, strategic visions. A theoretically informed, empirical account and analysis of NATO's recent evolution, this volume will appeal to both security scholars and practitioners from the policy community. -- Provided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aArms control. 0aNational securityzEurope. 0aEuropexDefenses. 4aElectronic books.1 aHilde, Paal Sigurd,d1970-1 aMichta, Andrew A.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.698080501750nam a2200409 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000390009202000360013102000280016702400250019504000180022005000210023808200200025910000430027924500650032226400100038726400590039730000230045633600260047933700260050533800360053150400510056750502820061858800570090065000150095765000480097265000440102065000180106465000440108265000260112665000130115265500220116571000610118785600920124820180127152300.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140318t20142014miu     ob    001 0 eng|d  a9780472119097q(hbk. : alk. paper)  a0472119095q(hbk. : alk. paper)  a9780472029662q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.1965125  aMiUbengcMiU 4aK5256b.D68 20140 a363.325/1562231 aDouglas, Rogerq(Roger Neil),eauthor.10aLaw, liberty, and the pursuit of terrorism /cRoger Douglas. 4c2014 1aAnn Arbor :bThe University of Michigan Press,c[2014]  a1 online resource   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aThe specter of terrorism -- Responding to the threat -- What is terrorism? -- Gathering information -- Protecting government secrets while protecting due process? -- Guilt by association -- Terrorism offences -- Detention without conviction -- Torture and coercive questioning.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aTerrorism. 0aTerrorismxPreventionxLaw and legislation. 0aNational securityxLaw and legislation. 0aCivil rights. 0aGovernment informationxAccess control. 0aDetention of persons. 0aTorture. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.196512503646nam a2200493 i 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005102000480009202000490014002000280018902400250021704000180024204300120026005000230027208200180029510000350031324500970034826400100044526400590045530000230051433600260053733700260056333800360058949000610062550400510068650504280073752011980116558800570236365000490242065000480246965000410251765000560255865000730261465000600268765000440274765100450279165100390283665100410287565500220291671000610293883000610299985600920306020180127152300.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||141003t20142014miu     ob   s001 0 eng|d  a9780472119417q(hardback : acid-free paper)  a9780472036059q(paperback : acid-free paper)  a9780472120543q(e-book)7 a10.3998/mpub.6713536  aMiUbengcMiU  ae-gw--- 4aHN460.V5bS43 20140 a303.609432231 aSedlmaier, Alexander,eauthor.10aConsumption and violence :bradical protest in Cold-War West Germany /cAlexander Sedlmaier. 4c2014 1aAnn Arbor :bThe University of Michigan Press,c[2014]  a1 online resource.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aDepartment Stores : Political Protest in the Commercial Sphere -- Neo-Marxist Critiques of Affluent Society : "Need to Break the Rules" -- Consumer Society under Fire : The Militant Targeting of an Abstract Enemy -- Public Transport : Protest against Fare Increases -- The Media : The Anti-Springer Campaign -- Urban Space : The Squatting Movement -- Global Responsibilities : In Search of Consumer Morality and Solidarity.2 a"Combining the tools of political, social, cultural, and intellectual history, Consumption and Violence : Radical Protest in Cold-War West Germany explores strategies of legitimization developed by advocates of militant resistance to certain manifestations of consumer capitalism. The book contributes to a more sober evaluation of West German protest movements, not just terrorism, as it refrains from emotional and moral judgments, but takes the protesters' approaches seriously, which, regarding consumer society, had a rational core. Political violence is not presented as the result of individual shortcomings, but emerges in relation to major societal changes, i.e., the unprecedented growth of consumption. This new perspective sheds important light on violence and radical protest in post-war Germany, as previous books have failed to examine to what extent these forms of resistance should be regarded as reactions to changing regimes of provision. Continuing the recently growing interest in the interdependence of countercultures and consumer society, the focus on violence gives the argument a unique twist, making the book thought-provoking and engaging"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aPolitical violencezGermany (West)xHistory. 0aProtest movementszGermany (West)xHistory. 0aRadicalismzGermany (West)xHistory. 0aGovernment, Resistance tozGermany (West)xHistory. 0aConsumption (Economics)xPolitical aspectszGermany (West)xHistory. 0aCapitalismxPolitical aspectszGermany (West)xHistory. 0aSocial changezGermany (West)xHistory. 0aGermany (West)xPolitics and government. 0aGermany (West)xSocial conditions. 0aGermany (West)xEconomic conditions. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher. 0aSocial history, popular culture, and politics in Germany40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.671353602310cam a22004094a 450000500170000000600190001700700150003600800410005101000150009202000180010702000150012502000440014002000390018402000240022302400250024704000180027204300120029005000260030208200200032810000270034824501140037526400580048930000220054733600260056933700260059533800360062150400260065750400510068350507880073458800570152260000620157965000510164165000330169265500220172571000610174785600920180820161228114645.0m     o  d        cr unu||||||||140814s2014    miu     o      00 0 eng d  z2014020602  a9780472120772  a0472120778  a9780472072453q(hardcover : alk. paper)  a9780472052455q(pbk. : alk. paper)  a0472072455q(print)7 a10.3998/mpub.6981447  aMiUbengcMiU  ae-sp---00aPN1995.9.R4bS35 201400a791.43/68232231 aScarlett, Elizabeth A.10aReligion and Spanish film :bLuis Buñuel, the Franco era, and contemporary directors /cElizabeth Scarlett. 1aAnn Arbor :bThe University of Michigan Press,c2014.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes filmography.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aIntroduction: God and the Spanish director -- Luis Buñuel and the reinvention of Catholicism -- Looking back in anger: iconoclastic and anticlerical roots -- Catholicism reinvented in later films -- The religious genre and its discontents in Francoist Spain -- History of the Christian religious genre film -- Preaching to the converted: missionaries and apparitions of Mary -- Lives of the saints as measures of holiness and citizenship -- New genres and new wave directors of the sixties and seventies -- Breaking boundaries: post-Franco and contemporary directors -- Variations on a theme of national identity: reclaiming St. Teresa -- Pedro Almodóvar and the gathering storm -- Postmodern skepticism versus the need to believe -- Conclusion: religion and the Spanish habitus.  aDescription based on information from the publisher.10aBuñuel, Luis,d1900-1983xCriticism and interpretation. 0aMotion pictureszSpainxHistory and criticism. 0aReligion in motion pictures. 4aElectronic books.2 aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.6981447

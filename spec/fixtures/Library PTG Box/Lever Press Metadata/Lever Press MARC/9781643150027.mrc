Less well known is that literature played a historical role in defining and teaching debt to the public. Promissory Notes: On the Literary Conditions of Debt addresses how neoliberal finance has depended upon a historical linking of geopolitical inequality and financial representation that positions the so-called "Third World" as negative value, or debt. Starting with an analysis of Anthony Trollope's novel, The Eustace Diamonds, Goodman shows how colonized spaces came to inhabit this negative value. Promissory Notesargues that the twentieth-century continues to apply literary innovations in character, subjectivity, temporal and spatial representation to construct debt as the negative creation of value not only in reference to objects, but also houses, credit cards, students, and, in particular, "Third World" geographies, often leading to crisis. Yet, late twentieth century and early twenty-first literary texts, such as Soyinka's The Road and Ngugi's Wizard of the Crow, address the negative space of the indebted world also as a critiqueof the financial take-over of the postcolonial developmental state. Looking to situations like the Puerto Rican debt crisis, Goodman demonstrates how financial discourse is articulated through social inequalities and how literature can both expose and contest the imposition of a morality of debt as a mode of anti-democratic control.1 fThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 Unported licenseuhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aDescription based on information from the publisher. 0aDebt in literature. 0aLiterature and society. 0aDebtxSocial aspects. 0aNeoliberalism. 0aEquality. 0aDemocracy. 4aElectronic books.22aMichigan Publishing (University of Michigan)epublisher.08iSupplement (work):aGoodman, Robin Truth, 1966-tSyllabus for Studies in Critical Theory: Literature and Debt, ENG 5049 (Spring 2017), instructed by Professor Robin Truth Goodman at Florida State University.h1 online resource (1 text file)40zAccess to the Michigan Publishing online version:uhttps://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10209707
